10192393	a common human skin tumour is caused by activating mutations in beta-catenin. wnt signalling orchestrates a number of developmental programs. in response to this stimulus, cytoplasmic beta-catenin (encoded by ctnnb1) is stabilized, enabling downstream transcriptional activation by members of the lef/tcf family. one of the target genes for beta-catenin/tcf encodes c-myc, explaining why constitutive activation of the wnt pathway can lead to DOID162MESHD009369, particularly in the colon. most DOID219DOID235MESHD003110 arise from mutations in the gene encoding DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125), a protein required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of beta-catenin, but a small percentage of colon and some other DOID162MESHD009369 harbour beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. recently, we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated beta-catenin are predisposed to developing skin tumours resembling pilomatricomas. given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis, we wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. here, we explore the cell origin and aetiology of this common human skin tumour. we found nuclear lef-1 in the dividing tumour cells, providing biochemical evidence that pilomatricomas are derived from hair matrix cells. at least 75% of these tumours possess mutations affecting the amino-terminal segment, normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the protein. this percentage of ctnnb1 mutations is greater than in all other human tumours examined thus far, and directly implicates beta-catenin/lef misregulation as the major cause of hair matrix cell MESHD063646 in humans.. 
10194428	OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 mutations analysis in 711 OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 probands: evidence for s65c implication in mild form of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432. hereditary OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 (hh) is a common autosomal recessive DOID630MESHD030342 of iron metabolism. the OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 candidate gene encoding an hla class i-like protein involved in hh was identified in 1996. two missense mutations have been described  c282y, accounting for 80% to 90% of hh chromosomes, and h63d, which is associated with a milder form of the DOID4MESHD004194 representing 40% to 70% of non-c282y hh chromosomes. we report here on the analysis of c282y, h63d, and the 193a-- > t substitution leading to the s65c missense substitution in a large series of probands and controls. the results confirm that the c282y substitution was the main mutation involved in OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432, accounting for 85% of carrier chromosomes, whereas the h63d substitution represented 39% of the hh chromosomes that did not carry the c282y mutation. in addition, our screening showed that the s65c substitution was significantly enriched in probands with at least one chromosome without an assigned mutation. this substitution accounted for 7. 8% of hh chromosomes that were neither c282y nor h63d. this enrichment of s65c among hh chromosomes suggests that the s65c substitution is associated with the mild form of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432.
