10192393	a common human skin tumour is caused by activating mutations in beta-catenin. wnt signalling orchestrates a number of developmental programs. in response to this stimulus, cytoplasmic beta-catenin (encoded by ctnnb1) is stabilized, enabling downstream transcriptional activation by members of the lef/tcf family. one of the target genes for beta-catenin/tcf encodes c-myc, explaining why constitutive activation of the wnt pathway can lead to DOID162MESHD009369, particularly in the colon. most DOID219DOID235MESHD003110 arise from mutations in the gene encoding DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125), a protein required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of beta-catenin, but a small percentage of colon and some other DOID162MESHD009369 harbour beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. recently, we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated beta-catenin are predisposed to developing skin tumours resembling pilomatricomas. given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis, we wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. here, we explore the cell origin and aetiology of this common human skin tumour. we found nuclear lef-1 in the dividing tumour cells, providing biochemical evidence that pilomatricomas are derived from hair matrix cells. at least 75% of these tumours possess mutations affecting the amino-terminal segment, normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the protein. this percentage of ctnnb1 mutations is greater than in all other human tumours examined thus far, and directly implicates beta-catenin/lef misregulation as the major cause of hair matrix cell MESHD063646 in humans.. 
10194428	OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 mutations analysis in 711 OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 probands: evidence for s65c implication in mild form of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432. hereditary OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 (hh) is a common autosomal recessive DOID630MESHD030342 of iron metabolism. the OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 candidate gene encoding an hla class i-like protein involved in hh was identified in 1996. two missense mutations have been described  c282y, accounting for 80% to 90% of hh chromosomes, and h63d, which is associated with a milder form of the DOID4MESHD004194 representing 40% to 70% of non-c282y hh chromosomes. we report here on the analysis of c282y, h63d, and the 193a-- > t substitution leading to the s65c missense substitution in a large series of probands and controls. the results confirm that the c282y substitution was the main mutation involved in OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432, accounting for 85% of carrier chromosomes, whereas the h63d substitution represented 39% of the hh chromosomes that did not carry the c282y mutation. in addition, our screening showed that the s65c substitution was significantly enriched in probands with at least one chromosome without an assigned mutation. this substitution accounted for 7. 8% of hh chromosomes that were neither c282y nor h63d. this enrichment of s65c among hh chromosomes suggests that the s65c substitution is associated with the mild form of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432. 
10196379	germline brca1 alterations in a population-based series of OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 cases. the objective of this study was to provide more accurate frequency estimates of OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 susceptibility gene 1 (brca1) germline alterations in the OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 population. to achieve this, we determined the prevalence of brca1 alterations in a population-based series of consecutive OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 cases. this is the first population-based OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 study reporting brca1 alterations derived from a comprehensive screen of the entire coding region. one hundred and seven OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 cases were analyzed for brca1 alterations using the rnase mismatch cleavage assay followed by direct sequencing. two truncating mutations, 962del4 and 3600del11, were identified. both patients had a family history of breast or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. several novel as well as previously reported uncharacterized variants were also identified, some of which were associated with a family history of DOID162MESHD009369. the frequency distribution of common polymorphisms was determined in the 91 caucasian DOID162MESHD009369 cases in this series and 24 sister controls using allele-specific amplification. the rare form of the q356r polymorphism was significantly (p = 0. 03) associated with a family history of OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051, suggesting that this polymorphism may influence OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 risk. in summary, our data suggest a role for some uncharacterized variants and rare forms of polymorphisms in determining OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 risk, and highlight the necessity to screen for missense alterations as well as truncating mutations in this population. 
10021369	identification of apc2, a homologue of the DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 tumour suppressor. the DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125) tumour-suppressor protein controls the wnt signalling pathway by forming a complex with glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (gsk-3beta), axin/conductin and betacatenin. complex formation induces the rapid degradation of betacatenin. in DOID1520 cells, loss of OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 leads to the accumulation of betacatenin in the nucleus, where it binds to and activates the tcf-4 transcription factor (reviewed in [1] [2]). here, we report the identification and genomic structure of OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 homologues. mammalian apc2, which closely resembles OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 in overall domain structure, was functionally analyzed and shown to contain two samp domains, both of which are required for binding to conductin. like OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125, apc2 regulates the formation of active betacatenin-tcf complexes, as demonstrated using transient transcriptional activation assays in OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 -/- DOID1520 cells. human apc2 maps to chromosome 19p13. 3. OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 and apc2 may therefore have comparable functions in development and DOID162MESHD009369.
100562	familial deficiency of the seventh component of complement associated with recurrent bacteremic MESHD007239 due to neisseria. the serum of a 29-year old woman with a recent episode of disseminated gonococcal MESHD007239 and a history of meningococcal DOID9471MESHD008581 and DOID848MESHD001168 as a child was found to lack serum hemolytic complement activity. the seventh component of complement (c7) was not detected by functional or immunochemical assays, whereas other components were normal by hemolytic and immunochemical assessment. her fresh serum lacked complement-mediated bactericidal activity against neisseria gonorrhoeae, but the addition of fresh normal serum or purified c7 restored bactericidal activity as well as hemolytic activity. the absence of functional c7 activity could not be accounted for on the basis of an inhibitor. opsonization and generation of chemotactic activity functioned normally. complete absence of c7 was also found in one sibling who had the clinical DOID225MESHD013577 of meningococcal DOID9471MESHD008581 and DOID848MESHD001168  as a child and in this siblings clinically well eight-year-old son. hla histocompatibility typing of the family members did not demonstrate evidence for genetic linkage of OMIM610102MESHC566443 with the major histocompatibility loci. this report represents the first cases of OMIM610102MESHC566443 associated with infectious complications and suggests that bactericidal activity may be important in host defense against bacteremic neisseria MESHD007239.
10078749	gch1 mutation in a patient with adult-onset oromandibular DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421. the authors report a mutation in exon 5 of gch1 in a patient with adult-onset oromandibular DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421 and no obvious family history of DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421. the patient responded positively to treatment with l-dopa. these findings demonstrate that gch1 mutations must be considered even in patients with dystonic symptoms not typical of dopa-responsive DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421.
10085150	the hereditary OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 protein, OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432, specifically regulates transferrin-mediated iron uptake in hela cells. OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 is the protein product of the gene mutated in the autosomal recessive DOID4MESHD004194 hereditary OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 (feder, j. n., gnirke, a., thomas, w., tsuchihashi, z., ruddy, d. a., basava, a., dormishian, f., domingo, r. j., ellis, m. c., fullan, a., hinton, l. m., jones, n. l., kimmel, b. e., kronmal, g. s., lauer, p., lee, v. k., loeb, d. b., mapa, f. a., mcclelland, e., meyer, n. c., mintier, g. a., moeller, n., moore, t., morikang, e., prasss, c. e ., quintana, l., starnes, s. m ., schatzman, r. c ., brunke, k. j ., drayna, d. t., risch, n. j ., bacon, b. r ., and wolff, r. r . (1996) nat. genet. 13, 399-408). at the cell surface, OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 complexes with transferrin receptor (tfr), increasing the DOID10935MESHD004213 constant of transferrin (tf) for its receptor 10-fold (gross, c. n ., irrinki, a., feder, j. n ., and enns, c. a . (1998) j. biol. chem. 273, 22068-22074; feder, j. n., penny, d. m., irrinki, a., lee, v. k., lebron, j. a., watson, n., tsuchihashi, z., sigal, e., bjorkman, p. j., and schatzman, r. c. (1998) proc. natl . acad. sci. u s a 95, 1472-1477). OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 does not remain at the cell surface, but traffics with tfr to tf-positive internal compartments (gross et al., 1998). using a hela cell line in which the expression of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 is controlled by tetracycline, we show that the expression of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 reduces 55fe uptake from tf by 33% but does not affect the endocytic or exocytic rates of tfr cycling. therefore, OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 appears to reduce cellular acquisition of iron from tf within endocytic compartments. OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 specifically reduces iron uptake from tf, as non-tf-mediated iron uptake from fe-nitrilotriacetic acid is not altered. these results explain the decreased ferritin levels seen in our hela cell system and demonstrate the specific control of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 over the tf-mediated pathway of iron uptake. these results also have implications for the understanding of cellular iron homeostasis in organs such as the liver, pancreas, heart, and spleen that are iron loaded in hereditary hemochromatotic individuals lacking functional OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432.
10090880	mutation and haplotype studies of familial mediterranean MESHD005334 reveal new ancestral relationships and evidence for a high carrier frequency with reduced penetrance in the ashkenazi jewish population. familial mediterranean MESHD005334 (OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of MESHD005334 with MESHD012700 or DOID2703DOID12225MESHD013585. the OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 gene (mefv) was cloned recently, and four missense mutations were identified. here we present data from non-ashkenazi jewish and arab patients in whom we had not originally found mutations and from a new, more ethnically diverse panel. among 90 symptomatic mutation-positive individuals, 11 mutations accounted for 79% of carrier chromosomes. of the two mutations that are novel, one alters the same residue (680) as a previously known mutation, and the other (p369s) is located in exon 3. consistent with another recent report, the e148q mutation was observed in patients of several ethnicities and on multiple microsatellite haplotypes, but haplotype data indicate an ancestral relationships between non-jewish italian and ashkenazi jewish patients with OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 and other affected populations. among approximately 200 anonymous ashkenazi jewish dna samples, the mefv carrier frequency was 21%, with e148q the most common mutation. several lines of evidence indicate reduced penetrance among ashkenazi jews, especially for e148q, p369s, and k695r. nevertheless, e148q helps account for recessive inheritance in an ashkenazi family previously reported as an unusual case of dominantly inherited OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505. the presence of three frequent mefv mutations in multiple mediterranean populations strongly suggests a heterozygote advantage in this geographic region.
10090885	OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735  with defective fas: genotype influences penetrance. OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735 (OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735) is a disorder of lymphocyte homeostasis and immunological tolerance. most patients have a heterozygous mutation in the apt1 gene, which encodes fas (cd95, apo-1), mediator of an apoptotic pathway crucial to lymphocyte homeostasis. of 17 unique apt1 mutations in unrelated OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735 probands, 12 (71%) occurred in exons 7-9, which encode the intracellular portion of fas. in vitro, activated lymphocytes from all 17 patients showed apoptotic defects when exposed to an anti-fas agonist monoclonal antibody. similar defects were found in a fas-negative cell line transfected with cdnas bearing each of the mutations. in cotransfection experiments, fas constructs with either intra- or extracellular mutations caused dominant inhibition of apoptosis mediated by wild-type fas. two missense fas variants, not restricted to patients with OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735, were identified. variant a (-1) t at the fas signal-sequence cleavage site, which mediates apoptosis less well than wild-type fas and is partially inhibitory, was present in 13% of african american alleles. among the OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735-associated fas mutants, dominant inhibition of apoptosis was much more pronounced in mutants affecting the intracellular, versus extracellular, portion of the fas receptor. mutations causing disruption of the intracellular fas MESHD003643 domain also showed a higher penetrance of OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735 phenotype features in mutation-bearing relatives. significant OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735-related morbidity occurred in 44% of relatives with intracellular mutations, versus 0% of relatives with extracellular mutations. thus, the location of mutations within apt1 strongly influences the development and the severity of OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735.
10190819	mutational analysis and genotype-phenotype correlation of 29 unrelated japanese patients with DOID10588OMIM300100MESHD000326. background  DOID10588OMIM300100MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326) is an inherited DOID4MESHD004194 characterized by progressive MESHD009461, occasionally associated with MESHD000309. the classic form of OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 usually has onset in childhood (childhood cerebral OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326), with rapid neurologic deterioration leading to a MESHD018458. adult-onset cerebral OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 also presents with rapidly progressive MESHD009461. milder phenotypes such as OMIM300100MESHD000326 and OMIM240200DOID13774MESHD000224 only also have been recognized. despite discovery of the causative gene, a molecular basis for the diverse clinical presentations remains to be elucidated. objectives  to conduct mutational analyses in 29 japanese patients with OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 from 29 unrelated families, to obtain knowledge of the spectrum of mutations in this gene, and to study genotype-phenotype correlations in japanese patients. methods  the 29 patients comprised 13 patients with childhood cerebral OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326, 11 patients with adult-onset cerebral OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326, and 5 patients with OMIM300100MESHD000326. we conducted detailed mutational analyses of 29 unrelated japanese patients with OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 by genomic southern blot analysis and direct nucleotide sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction products derived from total rna that was extracted from cultured skin fibroblasts, lymphoblastoid cells, or peripheral blood leukocytes. results  three patients with adult-onset cerebral OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 were identified as having large genomic rearrangements. the remaining 26 patients were identified as having 21 independent mutations, including 12 novel mutations resulting in small nucleotide alterations in the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 gene. eighteen (69%) of 26 mutations were missense mutations. most missense mutations involved amino acids conserved in homologous gene products, including pmp70, maldrp, and pxa1p. the ag dinucleotide deletion at position 1081-1082, which has been reported previously to be the most common mutation in white patients (12% -17%), was also identified as the most common mutation in japanese patients (12%). all phenotypes were associated with mutations resulting in protein truncation or subtle amino acid changes. there were no differences in phenotypic expressions between missense mutations involving conserved amino acids and those involving nonconserved amino acids. conclusions  there are no obvious correlations between the phenotypes of patients with OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 and their genotypes, suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors modify the phenotypic expressions of OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326.. 
6859721	absence of the seventh component of complement in a patient with chronic meningococcemia presenting as DOID865MESHD014657. a previously healthy 40-year-old man presenting with MESHD005334, DOID848MESHD001168, and cutaneous DOID865MESHD014657 was found to have chronic meningococcemia. evaluation of his complement system showed an absence of functional and antigenic c7, compatible with a complete deficiency of the seventh component of complement. study of the patients family spanning four generations showed heterozygous deficiency of c7 in five members. chronic neisserial MESHD007239 can be associated with OMIM610102MESHC566443 and must be distinguished from other causes of cutaneous DOID865MESHD014657.. 
10071185	genotype and phenotype in patients with OMIM274270DOID14218MESHD054067. dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (dpd) deficiency is an autosomal recessive DOID4MESHD004194 characterised by thymine-uraciluria in homozygous deficient patients and has been associated with a variable clinical phenotype. in order to understand the genetic and phenotypic basis for OMIM274270DOID14218MESHD054067, we have reviewed 17 families presenting 22 patients with complete deficiency of dpd. in this group of patients, 7 different mutations have been identified, including 2 deletions [295-298deltcat, 1897delc], 1 splice-site mutation [ivs14 + 1g > a)] and 4 missense mutations (85t > c, 703c > t, 2658g > a, 2983g > t). analysis of the prevalence of the various mutations among dpd patients has shown that the g-- > a point mutation in the invariant splice donor site is by far the most common (52%), whereas the other six mutations are less frequently observed. a large phenotypic variability has been observed, with convulsive disorders, motor retardation and DOID1059MESHD008607 being the most abundant manifestations. a clear correlation between the genotype and phenotype has not been established. an altered beta-alanine, uracil and thymine homeostasis might underlie the various clinical abnormalities encountered in patients with OMIM274270DOID14218MESHD054067.
1323345	molecular characterization of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency by natural and amplification created restriction sites: five mutations account for most DOID2862MESHD005955 cases in taiwan. we have developed a rapid and simple method to diagnose the molecular defects of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency in chinese in taiwan. this method involves the selective amplification of a dna fragment from human g6pd gene with specific oligonucleotide primers followed by digestion with restriction enzymes that recognize artificially created or naturally occurring restriction sites. ninety-four chinese males with DOID2862MESHD005955 were studied. the results show that 50% (47 of 94) were g to t mutation at nucleotide (nt) 1376, 21. 3% (20 of 94) were g to a mutation at nt 1388, 7. 4% (7 of 94) were a to g mutation at nt 493, 7. 4% (7 of 94) were a to g mutation at nt 95, 4. 2% (4 of 94) were c to t mutation at nt 1024, 1. 1% (1 of 94) was g to t mutation at nt 392, and 1. 1% (1 of 94) was g to a mutation at nt 487. these results show that the former five mutations account for more than 90% of DOID2862MESHD005955 cases in taiwan. aside from showing that g to t change at nt 1376 is the most common mutation, our research indicates that nt 493 mutation is a frequent mutation among chinese in taiwan. we compared g6pd activity among different mutations, without discovering significant differences between them.
2828430	homozygous DOID1390MESHD006995: a DOID4MESHD004194 distinct from abetalipoproproteinemia at the molecular level. apob dna, rna, and protein from two patients with homozygous DOID1390MESHD006995 (hbl) were evaluated and compared with normal individuals. southern blot analysis with 10 different cdna probes revealed a normal gene without major insertions, deletions, or rearrangements. northern and slot blot analyses of total liver mrna from hbl patients documented a normal size apob mrna that was present in greatly reduced quantities. apob protein was detected within hbl hepatocytes utilizing immunohistochemical techniques; however, it was markedly reduced in quantity when compared with control samples. no apob was detectable in the plasma of hbl individuals with an elisa assay. these data are most consistent with a mutation in the coding portion of the apob gene in hbl patients, leading to an abnormal apob protein and apob mrna instability. these results are distinct from those previously noted in OMIM200100DOID1386MESHD000012, which was characterized by an elevated level of hepatic apob mrna and accumulation of intracellular hepatic apob protein.. 
10471457	a population-based study of the clinical expression of the OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 gene. background and methods  hereditary OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 is associated with homozygosity for the c282y mutation in the OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 (OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432) gene on chromosome 6, elevated serum transferrin saturation, and excess iron deposits throughout the body. to assess the prevalence and clinical expression of the OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 gene, we conducted a population-based study in busselton, australia. in 1994, we obtained blood samples for the determination of serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels and the presence or absence of the c282y mutation and the h63d mutation (which may contribute to increased hepatic iron levels) in 3011 unrelated white adults. we evaluated all subjects who had persistently elevated transferrin-saturation values (45 percent or higher) or were homozygous for the c282y mutation. we recommended liver biopsy for subjects with serum ferritin levels of 300 ng per milliliter or higher. the subjects were followed for up to four years. results  sixteen of the subjects (0. 5 percent) were homozygous for the c282y mutation, and 424 (14. 1 percent) were heterozygous. the serum transferrin saturation was 45 percent or higher in 15 of the 16 who were homozygous; in 1 subject it was 43 percent. four of the homozygous subjects had previously been given a diagnosis of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432, and 12 had not. seven of these 12 patients had elevated serum ferritin levels in 1994; 6 of the 7 had further increases in 1998, and 1 had a decrease, although the value remained elevated. the serum ferritin levels in the four other homozygous patients remained in the normal range. eleven of the 16 homozygous subjects underwent liver biopsy; 3 had hepatic MESHD005355, and 1, who had a history of excessive alcohol consumption, had DOID5082MESHD005355 and mild microvesicular steatosis. eight of the 16 homozygous subjects had clinical findings that were consistent with the presence of hereditary OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432, such as MESHD006529, skin pigmentation, and DOID848MESHD001168. conclusions  in a population of white adults of northern european ancestry, 0. 5 percent were homozygous for the c282y mutation in the OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 gene. however, only half of those who were homozygous had clinical features of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432, and one quarter had serum ferritin levels that remained normal over a four-year period.
7574457	overexpression of dm20 messenger rna in two brothers with pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194. pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 is a rare, sex-linked recessive, dysmyelinating DOID4MESHD004194 of the central nervous system that has been associated with mutations in the myelin proteolipid protein (plp) gene. only 25% of patients studied with pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 have exonic mutations in this gene, the underlying cause of the DOID4MESHD004194 in the remaining patients is unknown. the plp gene encodes two major alternatively spliced transcripts called plp and dm20. plp messenger rna is specifically expressed in central nervous system tissue, whereas dm20 messenger rna is found in central nervous system, cardiac, and other tissues. we studied cultured skin fibroblasts from 2 brothers with pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 who exhibited no detectable exonic mutation of the plp gene. examination of rna from these cells showed that the level of dm20 messenger rna is elevated sixfold relative to male control skin fibroblasts. an unrelated female carrier, also with no detectable exonic mutation, showed a threefold increase in dm20 messenger rna in cultured skin fibroblasts. our findings suggest that in some patients, pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 is caused by overexpression of plp gene transcripts, and that in these families a 50% increase of dm20 messenger rna in females, relative to the increase in affected males, can identify a female carrier.. 
10466420	homozygosity for a novel dtdst mutation in a child with a 'broad bone-platyspondylic' variant of OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170. atypical or variant forms of well-known chondrodysplasias may pose diagnostic problems. we report on a girl with clinical features suggesting OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170 but with unusual radiographic features including severe platyspondyly, wide metaphyses, and fibular overgrowth, which are partially reminiscent of OMIM156530DOID0111514MESHC537356. the diagnosis was clarified by molecular analysis of the dtdst gene, which revealed homozygosity for a previously undescribed mutation leading to a q454p substitution in the 10th transmembrane domain of the dtdst sulfate transporter. molecular analysis may be of particular value in such atypical cases.. 
1676565	carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 using a combination of anonymous dna polymorphisms and the proteolipid protein (plp) gene cdna. we report carrier identification and a prenatal diagnosis using dna polymorphisms in 2 families with x-linked pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 (OMIM312080OMIM601186DOID3210OMIM169500MESHD020371). in both families, the proteolipid protein (plp) gene in the single affected male could be traced back to his unaffected maternal grandfather. therefore, each family contains a new mutation. in the case of the prenatal diagnosis, the fetus was shown by cytogenetic analysis to be a female, who we predict will be a noncarrier of OMIM312080OMIM601186DOID3210OMIM169500MESHD020371 based on her genotype with the plp intragenic polymorphism.. 
1776638	MESHD005736 in a boy with interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5. we described a 15-year-old boy with MESHD005736 (gs), DOID1059MESHD008607, and MESHD019465. high-resolution banding analysis showed an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (q22. 1----q31 1----q31. 1). the breakpoints in the present case and in 3 previously reported 5q- patients with DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 suggest that the gene responsible for gs/or DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125) is in the 5q22 region, a result consistent with the findings of linkage studies 
1577763	type i human complement OMIM217000DOID0060295. a 28-base pair gene deletion causes skipping of exon 6 during rna splicing. two variants of a genetic deficiency of complement protein c2 (OMIM217000DOID0060295) have been previously identified. no c2 protein translation is detected in type i deficiency, while type ii deficiency is characterized by a selective block in c2 secretion. type i OMIM217000DOID0060295 was described in a family in which the c2 null allele (c2q0) is associated with the major histocompatibility haplotype/complotype hla-a25, b18, c2q0, bfs, c4a4, c4b2, drw2; this extended haplotype occurs in over 90% of c2-deficient individuals (common complotype/haplotype). to determine the molecular basis of type i OMIM217000DOID0060295, the c2 gene and cdna were characterized from a homozygous type i c2-deficient individual with the common associated haplotype/complotype. we found a 28-base pair deletion in the type i c2q0 gene, beginning 9 base pairs upstream of the 3-end of exon 6, that generates a c2 transcript with a complete deletion of exon 6 (134 base pair) and a premature termination codon. in studies of eight kindred, the 28-base pair deletion was observed in all c2q0 alleles associated with the common type i deficient complotype/haplotype; this deletion was not present in normal c2 nor in type ii c2-deficient genes. these data demonstrate that  1) type i human complement OMIM217000DOID0060295 is caused by a 28-base pair genomic deletion that causes skipping of exon 6 during rna splicing, resulting in generation of a premature termination codon, 2) the 28-base pair deletion in the type i c2q0 gene is strongly associated with the hla haplotype/complotype a25, b18, c2q0, bfs, c4a4, c4b2, drw2, suggesting that all c2-deficient individuals with this haplotype/complotype will harbor the 28-base pair c2 gene deletion, and 3) type ii OMIM217000DOID0060295 is caused by a different, as yet uncharacterized, molecular genetic OMIM188560.. 
10767339	(over)correction of fmr1 deficiency with yac transgenics: behavioral and physical features. OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600 is a common cause of DOID1059MESHD008607 involving loss of expression of the fmr1 gene. the role of fmr1 remains undetermined but the protein appears to be involved in rna metabolism. fmr1 knockout mice exhibit a phenotype with some similarities to humans, such as macroorchidism and behavioral abnormalities. as a step toward understanding the function of fmr1 and the determination of the potential for therapeutic approaches to OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600, yeast artificial chromosome (yac) transgenic mice were generated in order to determine whether the fmr1 knockout mouse phenotype could be rescued. several transgenic lines were generated that carried the entire fmr1 locus with extensive amounts of flanking sequence. we observed that the yac transgene supported production of the human protein (fmrp) which was present at levels 10 to 15 times that of endogenous protein and was expressed in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. macro-orchidism was absent in knockout mice carrying the yac transgene indicating functional rescue by the human protein. given the complex behavioral phenotype in fragile x patients and the mild phenotype previously reported for the fmr1 knockout mouse, we performed a more thorough evaluation of the fmr1 knockout phenotype using additional behavioral assays that had not previously been reported for this animal model. the mouse displayed reduced OMIM607834DOID2030MESHD001008-related responses with increased exploratory behavior. fmr1 yac transgenic mice overexpressing the human protein did produce opposing behavioral responses and additional abnormal behaviors were also observed. these findings have significant implications for gene therapy for OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600 since overexpression of the gene may harbor its own phenotype.. 
10208848	OMIM301500DOID14499MESHD000795: identification of novel alpha-galactosidase a mutations and molecular carrier detection by use of fluorescent chemical cleavage of mismatches. OMIM301500DOID14499MESHD000795 (fd) (DOID479MESHD000794 corporis diffusum) is an x-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by defects in the lysosomal alpha-galactosidase a gene (gla). the enzymatic OMIM188560 leads to the systemic accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids with terminal alpha-galactosyl moieties. clinically, affected hemizygous males have DOID479MESHD000794, severe acroparesthesia, DOID1074MESHD051437, and vasculopathy of the heart and brain. while demonstration of alpha-galactosidase deficiency in leukocytes is diagnostic in affected males, enzymatic detection of female carriers is often inconclusive, due to random x-chromosomal inactivation, underlining the need of molecular investigations for accurate genetic counseling. by use of chemical cleavage of mismatches adapted to fluorescence-based detection systems, we have characterized the mutations underlying alpha-gal a deficiency in 16 individuals from six unrelated families with fd. the mutational spectrum OMIM612069MESHC567429OMIM606217MESHC565249OMIM115197MESHC566169DOID0110552OMIM606346DOID0110494OMIM609006OMIM300123MESHC567485DOID0111806OMIM610125MESHC566441DOID0110927OMIM161800OMIM611590MESHC566910OMIM613750MESHC563526 five missense mutations (c202w, c223g, n224d, r301q, and q327k) and one splice-site mutation [ivs3 g (-1) -- > c]. studies at the mrna level showed that the latter led to altered pre-mrna splicing with consequent alteration of the mrna translational reading frame and generation of a premature termination codon of translation. by use of this strategy, carrier status was accurately assessed in all seven at-risk females tested, whereas enzymatic dosages failed to diagnose or exclude heterozygosity.. 
8533768	evidence for linkage of DOID3312MESHD001714 to chromosome 18 with a parent-of-origin effect. a susceptibility gene on chromosome 18 and a parent-of-origin effect have been suggested for bipolar DOID3324MESHD019964 (OMIM125480OMIM309200OMIM611247OMIM611535OMIM611536MESHC565111MESHC564108MESHC567073MESHC567074MESHC567075). we have studied 28 nuclear families selected for apparent unilineal transmission of the OMIM125480OMIM309200OMIM611247OMIM611535OMIM611536MESHC565111MESHC564108MESHC567073MESHC567074MESHC567075 phenotype, by using 31 polymorphic markers spanning chromosome 18. evidence for linkage was tested with affected-sib-pair and lod score methods under two definitions of the affected phenotype. the affected-sibpair analyses indicated excess allele sharing for markers on 18p within the region reported previously. the greatest sharing was at d18s37  64% in bipolar and recurrent unipolar (rup) sib pairs (p =. 0006). in addition, excess sharing of the paternally, but not maternally, transmitted alleles was observed at three markers on 18q  at d18s41, 51 bipolar and rup sib pairs were concordant for paternally transmitted alleles, and 21 pairs were discordant (p = 0004). the evidence for linkage to loci on both 18p and 18q was strongest in the 11 paternal pedigrees, i. e e., those in which the father or one of the fathers sibs is affected. in these pedigrees, the greatest allele sharing (81%; p =. 00002) and the highest lod score (3. 51; phi = 0. 0) were observed at d18s41. our results provide further support for linkage of OMIM125480OMIM309200OMIM611247OMIM611535OMIM611536MESHC565111MESHC564108MESHC567073MESHC567074MESHC567075 to chromosome 18 and the first molecular evidence for a parent-of-origin effect operating in this disorder. the number of loci involved, and their precise location, require further study 
8531967	brca1 mutations in a population-based sample of young women with OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943. background. inherited mutations in the brca1 gene are associated with a high risk of breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 in some families. however, little is known about the contribution of brca1 mutations to OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 in the general population. we analyzed dna samples from women enrolled in a population-based study of early-onset OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 to assess the spectrum and frequency of germ-line brca1 mutations in young women with OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943. methods. we studied 80 women in whom OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 was diagnosed before the age of 35, and who were not selected on the basis of family history. genomic dna was studied for brca1 mutations by analysis involving single-strand conformation polymorphisms and with allele-specific assays. alterations were defined by dna sequencing. results. germ-line brca1 mutations were identified in 6 of the 80 women. four additional rare sequence variants of unknown functional importance were also identified. two of the mutations and three of the rare sequence variants were found among the 39 women who reported no family history of breast or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. none of the mutations and only one of the rare variants was identified in a reference population of 73 unrelated subjects. conclusions. alterations in brca1 were identified in approximately 10 percent of this cohort of young women with OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943. the risk of harboring a mutation was not limited to women with family histories of breast or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. these results represent a minimal estimate of the frequency of brca1 mutations in this population. comprehensive methods of identifying brca1 mutations and understanding their importance will be needed before testing of women in the general population can be undertaken.. 
10915776	retinoschisin, the x-linked DOID8465OMIM312700MESHD041441 protein, is a secreted photoreceptor protein, and is expressed and released by weri-OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 cells. x-linked DOID8465OMIM312700MESHD041441 is characterized by microcystic-like changes of the macular region and schisis within the inner retinal layers, leading to visual deterioration in males. many missense and protein-truncating mutations of the causative gene OMIM312700DOID8465MESHD041441 have now been identified and are thought to be inactivating. OMIM312700DOID8465MESHD041441 encodes a 224 amino acid protein, retinoschisin, which contains a discoidin domain but is of unknown function. we have generated a polyclonal antibody against a peptide from a unique region within retinoschisin, which detects a protein of approximately 28 kda in retinal samples reduced with dithiothreitol, but multimers sized > 40 kda under non-reducing conditions. a screen of human tissues with this antibody reveals retinoschisin to be retina specific and the antibody detects a protein of similar size in bovine and murine retinae. we investigated the expression pattern in the retina of both OMIM312700DOID8465MESHD041441 mrna (using in situ hybridization with riboprobes) and retinoschisin (using immunohistochemistry). the antisense riboprobe detected OMIM312700DOID8465MESHD041441 mrna only in the photoreceptor layer but the protein product of the gene was present both in the photoreceptors and within the inner portions of the retina. furthermore, differentiated OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 cells (weri-OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 cells) were found to express OMIM312700DOID8465MESHD041441 mrna and to release retinoschisin. these results suggest that retinoschisin is released by photo-receptors and has functions within the inner retinal layers. thus, x-linked DOID8465OMIM312700MESHD041441 is caused by abnormalities in a putative secreted photoreceptor protein and is the first example of a secreted photo-receptor protein associated with a DOID8501MESHD058499.. 
1302003	aberrant splicing of the OMIM231090OMIM303100MESHD015794DOID3590OMIM614293MESHD006828 gene is a significant cause of OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794. OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794 (OMIM231090OMIM303100MESHD015794DOID3590OMIM614293MESHD006828) is an x-linked progressive degeneration of the choroid and retina. 12% of unrelated male patients carry deletions of the partially cloned OMIM231090OMIM303100MESHD015794DOID3590OMIM614293MESHD006828 gene. in finland, there are more than 120 living OMIM231090OMIM303100MESHD015794DOID3590OMIM614293MESHD006828 patients belonging to eight apparently unrelated pedigrees. molecular deletions involving the OMIM231090OMIM303100MESHD015794DOID3590OMIM614293MESHD006828 gene have been detected in three families. we have screened the remaining five families for point mutations. in one large family a single nucleotide (t) insertion into the donor splice site of exon c leads to two aberrantly spliced mrnas both producing a premature stop codon. the mutation can be assayed easily by amplification and digestion with msel. our findings provide additional evidence for the pathogenetic role of OMIM231090OMIM303100MESHD015794DOID3590OMIM614293MESHD006828 mutations and provide a diagnostic tool for one fifth of the worlds known OMIM231090OMIM303100MESHD015794DOID3590OMIM614293MESHD006828 patients.. 
7811247	DOID10588OMIM300100MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326): a novel mutation of the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 gene in 6 members of a family presenting with 5 different phenotypes. fragments of the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326) cdna from a patient with adolescent OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned. bidirectional sequencing of the entire coding OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 gene disclosed a cytosine to guanine transversion at nucleotide 1451 in exon five, resulting in substitution of proline 484 by arginine. five of nine siblings of the patient, comprising two cerebral OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326, one OMIM300100MESHD000326, one addison only as well as the symptomatic mother (all accumulating very long chain fatty acids) carried this mutation, which was not found in the unaffected persons, in five unrelated OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 patients, and in twenty controls. we propose that this missense mutation generated the DOID4MESHD004194 per se as well as the metabolic OMIM188560; the different phenotypes, however, must have originated by means of additional pathogenetic factors..

10364518	characterization of a germline mosaicism in families with OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800, and identification of seven novel mutations in the OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 gene. the DOID1056OMIM309000MESHD009800 (OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800) is an x-linked disorder characterized by major abnormalities of eyes, nervous system, and kidneys. mutations in the OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 gene have been associated with the DOID4MESHD004194. OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-biphosphate (ptdins [4, 5] p2) 5-phosphatase. we have examined the OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 gene in eight unrelated patients with OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 and have found seven new mutations and one recurrent in-frame deletion. among the new mutations, two nonsense mutations (r317x and e558x) and three other frameshift mutations caused premature termination of the protein. a missense mutation, r483g, was located in the highly conserved ptdins (4, 5) p2 5-phosphatase domain. finally, one frameshift mutation, 2799delc, modifies the c-terminal part of OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800, with an extension of six amino acids. altogether, 70% of missense mutations are located in exon 15, and 52% of all mutations cluster in exons 11-15. we also identified two new microsatellite markers for the OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 locus, and we detected a germline mosaicism in one family. this observation has direct implications for genetic counseling of OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 families.. 
10449429	aminoglycoside antibiotics restore dystrophin function to skeletal muscles of OMIM309200MESHC564108 mice. duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, leading to the absence of the dystrophin protein in striated muscle. a significant number of these mutations are premature stop codons. on the basis of the observation that aminoglycoside treatment can suppress stop codons in cultured cells, we tested the effect of gentamicin on cultured muscle cells from the OMIM309200MESHC564108 mouse - an animal model for OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 that possesses a premature stop codon in the dystrophin gene. exposure of OMIM309200MESHC564108 myotubes to gentamicin led to the expression and localization of dystrophin to the cell membrane. we then evaluated the effects of differing dosages of gentamicin on expression and functional protection of the muscles of OMIM309200MESHC564108 mice. we identified a treatment regimen that resulted in the presence of dystrophin in the cell membrane in all striated muscles examined and that provided functional protection against muscular MESHD014947. to our knowledge, our results are the first to demonstrate that aminoglycosides can suppress stop codons not only in vitro but also in vivo. furthermore, these results raise the possibility of a novel treatment regimen for DOID9884MESHD009136 and other DOID4MESHD004194MESHC caused by premature stop codon mutations. this treatment could prove effective in up to 15% of patients with OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388.. 
1939657	molecular and metabolic basis for the metabolic disorder normotriglyceridemic OMIM200100DOID1386MESHD000012. we have previously described a disorder, normotriglyceridemic OMIM200100DOID1386MESHD000012, that is characterized by the virtual absence of plasma low density lipoproteins and complete absence of apob-100, but with apparently normal secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins containing apob-48. the patients plasma lipoproteins were shown on polyacrylamide gels and by antibody mapping to have a new truncated apob variant, apob-50, circulating along with her apob-48. we have found this individual to be homozygous for a single c-to-t nucleotide substitution at apob codon 2252, which produces a premature in-frame stop codon. thus, this is a rare example of homozygous DOID1390MESHD006995. electron photomicrographs revealed that the diameters of particles in the d less than 1. 006 g/ml lipoprotein fraction, in both the postprandial and postabsorptive state, are bimodally distributed. the molar ratio of apoe to apob in these particles is 3. 5  1, similar to normal vldl. the plasma ldl interval contains both spherical and cuboidal particles. autologous reinfusion of labeled d less than 1. 006 g/ml lipoproteins showed exponential disappearance from plasma, with an apparent half-removal time of 50 min, somewhat slower than for normal chylomicrons but within the normal range for vldl. the calculated production rate for apob was within the normal range in this subject. 
1409710	DOID12531MESHD014842 type b: a missense mutation selectively abolishes ristocetin-induced von willebrand factor binding to platelet glycoprotein ib. von willebrand factor (vwf) is a multimeric glycoprotein that mediates the adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium by binding to platelet glycoprotein ib. for human vwf, this interaction can be induced in vitro by the antibiotic ristocetin or the snake venom protein botrocetin. a missense mutation, gly-561-- > ser, was identified within the proposed glycoprotein ib binding domain of vwf in the proband with DOID12531MESHD014842 type b, a unique variant characterized by no ristocetin-induced, but normal botrocetin-induced, binding to glycoprotein ib. the corresponding mutant recombinant protein, rvwf (g561s), formed normal multimers and exhibited the same functional OMIM188560 as the patients plasma vwf, confirming that this mutation causes DOID12531MESHD014842 type b. these data show that botrocetin and ristocetin cofactor activities of vwf can be dissociated by a point mutation and confirm that these mediators promote vwf binding to platelets by different mechanisms. the normal botrocetin-induced binding and the defective ristocetin-induced binding of rvwf (g561s) suggest that the primary OMIM188560 in DOID12531MESHD014842 type b may be a failure of normal allosteric regulation of the glycoprotein ib binding function of vwf.. 
8554067	a high incidence of brca1 mutations in 20 breast-OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 families. we have analyzed 20 breast-OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 families, the majority of which show positive evidence of linkage to chromosome 17q12 for germ-line mutations in the brca1 gene. brca1 mutations cosegregating with breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 susceptibility were identified in 16 families, including 1 family with a case of DOID1614MESHD018567. nine of these mutations have not been reported previously. the majority of mutations were found to generate a premature stop codon leading to the formation of a truncated brca1 protein of 2% -88% of the expected normal length. two mutations altered the ring finger domain. sequencing of genomic dna led to the identification of a mutation in the coding region of brca1 in 12 families, and cdna analysis revealed an abnormal or missing brca1 transcript in 4 of the 8 remaining families. a total of eight mutations were associated with a reduced quantity of brca1 transcript. we were unable to detect brca1 mutations in 4 of the 20 families, but only 1 of these was clearly linked to brca1. it is expected that the majority of clear examples of the breast-ovarian DOID225MESHD013577 will be associated with germ-line mutations in the coding region of brca1.. 
8244393	assignment of the human na+/glucose cotransporter gene sglt1 to chromosome 22q13.1. the na +/glucose cotransporter gene sglt1 encodes the primary carrier protein responsible for the uptake of the dietary sugars glucose and galactose from the intestinal lumen. sglt1 transport activity is currently exploited in oral rehydration therapy. the 75-kda glycoprotein is localized in the brush border of the intestinal epithelium and is predicted to comprise 12 membrane spans. in two patients with the autosomal recessive DOID4MESHD004194 OMIM606824MESHC562602, the underlying cause was found to be a missense mutation in sglt1, and the asp28-- > asn change was demonstrated in vitro to eliminate sglt1 transport activity. the sglt1 gene was previously shown to reside on the distal q arm of chromosome 22 (11. 2-- > qter). we have used a cosmid probe for fluorescence in situ hybridization, which refines the localization to 22q13. 1, and provide an example of the utility of the sglt1 probe as a diagnostic for DOID630MESHD030342 associated with translocations of chromosome 22.
1384323	a pseudodeficiency allele common in non-jewish tay-sachs carriers: implications for carrier screening. deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase a (hex a) activity typically results in OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661. however, healthy subjects found to be deficient in hex a activity (i. e., pseudodeficient) by means of in vitro biochemical tests have been described. we analyzed the hexa gene of one pseudodeficient subject and identified both a c739-to-t substitution that changes arg247----trp on one allele and a previously identified OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 mutation on the second allele. six additional pseudodeficient subjects were found to have the c739-to-t mutation. this allele accounted for 32% (20/62) of non-jewish enzyme-defined OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 carriers but for none of 36 jewish enzyme-defined carriers who did not have one of three known mutations common to this group. the c739-to-t allele, together with a " true " OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 allele, causes hex a pseudodeficiency. given both the large proportion of non-jewish carriers with this allele and that standard biochemical screening cannot differentiate between heterozygotes for the c739-to-t mutations and OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 carriers, dna testing for this mutation in at-risk couples is essential. 
1307230	the presence of two different infantile OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 mutations in a cajun population. a study was undertaken to characterize the mutation (s) responsible for OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 (OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661) in a cajun population in southwest louisiana and to identify the origins of these mutations. eleven of 12 infantile OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 alleles examined in six families had the beta-hexosaminidase a (hex a) alpha-subunit exon 11 insertion mutation that is present in approximately 70% of ashkenazi jewish OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 heterozygotes. the mutation in the remaining allele was a single-base transition in the donor splice site of the alpha-subunit intron 9. to determine the origins of these two mutations in the cajun population, the OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 carrier status was enzymatically determined for 90 members of four of the six families, and extensive pedigrees were constructed for all carriers. a single ancestral couple from france was found to be common to most of the carriers of the exon 11 insertion. pedigree data suggest that this mutation has been in the cajun population since its founding over 2 centuries ago and that it may be widely distributed within the population. in contrast, the intron 9 mutation apparently was introduced within the last century and probably is limited to a few louisiana families.. 
8088831	OMIM271900DOID3613MESHD017825: genomic organization and localization of human aspa to 17p13-ter and conservation of the aspa gene during evolution. OMIM271900DOID3613MESHD017825, or DOID3613OMIM271900MESHD017825, is a severe DOID10579 caused by the deficiency of aspartoacylase (aspa). recently, a missense mutation was identified in human aspa coding sequence from patients with OMIM271900DOID3613MESHD017825. the human aspa gene has been cloned and found to span 29 kb of the genome. human aspartoacylase is coded by six exons intervened by five introns. the exons vary from 94 (exon iii) to 514 (exon vi) bases. the exon/intron splice junction sites follow the gt/ag consensus sequence rule. southern blot analysis of genomic dna from human/mouse somatic cell hybrid cell lines localized aspa to human chromosome 17. the human aspa locus was further mapped in the 17p13-ter region by fluorescence in situ hybridization. the bovine aspa gene has also been cloned, and its exon/intron organization is identical to that of the human gene. the 500-base sequence upstream of the initiator atg codon in the human gene and that in the bovine gene are 77% identical. human aspa coding sequences cross-hybridize with genomic dna from yeast, chicken, rabbit, cow, dog, mouse, rat, and monkey. the specificity of cross-species hybridization of coding sequences suggests that aspartoacylase has been conserved during evolution. it should now be possible to identify mutations in the noncoding genomic sequences that lead to OMIM271900DOID3613MESHD017825 and to study the regulation of aspa.. 
6524872	OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326: survey of 303 cases: biochemistry, diagnosis, and therapy. OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326) is a genetically determined disorder associated with progressive central DOID3213MESHD003711 and DOID10493. all affected persons show increased levels of saturated unbranched very-long-chain fatty acids, particularly hexacosanoate (c26  0), because of impaired capacity to degrade these acids. this degradation normally takes place in a subcellular organelle called the peroxisome, and OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326, together with zellwegers OMIM214100DOID905MESHD015211, is now considered to belong to the newly formed category of DOID906MESHD018901. biochemical assays permit prenatal diagnosis, as well as identification of most heterozygotes. we have identified 303 patients with OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 in 217 kindreds. these patients show a wide phenotypic variation. sixty percent of patients had childhood OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 and 17% OMIM300100MESHD000326, both of which are x-linked, with the gene mapped to xq28. neonatal OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326, a distinct entity with autosomal recessive inheritance and points of resemblance to zellwegers DOID225MESHD013577, accounted for 7% of the cases. although excess c26  0 in the brain of patients with OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 is partially of dietary origin, dietary c26  0 restriction did not produce clear benefit. bone marrow transplant lowered the plasma c26  0 level but failed to arrest neurological progression.. 
10441343	french OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 patients do not exhibit gametic segregation distortion: a sperm typing analysis. segregation distortion has been reported to occur in a number of the trinucleotide repeat disorders. on the basis of a sperm typing study performed in patients of japanese descent with OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 (OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827), it was reported that DOID4MESHD004194 alleles are preferentially transmitted during meiosis. we performed a sperm typing study of five OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 patients of french descent and analysis of the pooled data shows a ratio of mutant to normal alleles of 379  436 (46. 5  53. 5%), which does not support meiotic segregation distortion. to confirm these results, sperm typing analysis was also performed using a polymorphic marker, d14s1050, closely linked to the mjd1 gene. among 910 sperm analyzed, the allele linked to the DOID4MESHD004194 chromosome was detected in 50. 3% of the samples and the allele linked to the normal chromosome was found in 49. 6% of the sperm. the difference in frequency of these two alleles is not significant (p = 0. 8423). likelihood-based analysis of segregation distortion in the single sperm data using the spermseg program also showed no support for segregation distortion at the gamete level in this patient population. the previous report on the japanese patients also suggested that DOID4MESHD004194 allele stability may be influenced by a trans effect of an intragenic polymorphism (987 g/c) in the wild-type allele. all of the french patients were heterozygous for this polymorphism. however, analysis of the variance in repeat number in sperm from the french OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 patients overlapped significantly with the variance in repeat number observed in the c/c homozygous japanese patients.
3346018	nebulin seen in OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 males including one patient with a large dna deletion encompassing the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene. the presence of nebulin in a muscle specimen from a patient with duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) due to a large deletion precludes the possibility that this protein is the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene product.. 
8188241	the human gene for OMIM203500DOID9270MESHD000474 (OMIM203500MESHD000474) maps to chromosome 3q. OMIM203500DOID9270MESHD000474 (OMIM203500MESHD000474; mckusick no. 203500) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the lack of homogentisic acid oxidase activity. patients excrete large amounts of homogentisic acid in their urine and a black ochronotic pigment is deposited in their cartilage and collagenous tissues. DOID14223MESHD009794 is the predominant clinical complication of the DOID4MESHD004194 leading to ochronotic DOID381MESHD007592, dark urine, pigment changes of the skin, and other clinical features. a mutation causing OMIM203500DOID9270MESHD000474 in the mouse has mapped to chromosome 16. considering conserved synteny, we were able to map the human gene to chromosome 3q in six OMIM203500DOID9270MESHD000474 pedigrees of slovak origin.. 
1317264	the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene, responsible for DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125, is mutated in human OMIM613659DOID10534OMIM137215MESHD013274. although OMIM613659DOID10534OMIM137215MESHD013274 is the most common DOID162MESHD009369 in the world, genetic changes during its MESHD063646 are not well understood. since some gastric DOID162MESHD009369 are considered to originate from the intestinal MESHD008679, it is likely that the DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125) gene, the mutation of which causes adenomatous MESHD011127 in the colon, is associated with MESHD063646 of OMIM613659DOID10534OMIM137215MESHD013274. based on this idea, dnas isolated from gastric DOID162MESHD009369 were examined by means of a rnase protection analysis coupled with polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products. by screening nearly one-half of the coding region of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene in 44 DOID162MESHD009369, somatic mutations were detected in three DOID162MESHD009369  a missense mutation, a nonsense mutation, and a 5-base pair deletion resulting in a frame shift which causes truncation of the gene product. these results suggest that the mutation of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene also plays an important role during the MESHD063646 of at least some gastric DOID162MESHD009369.. 
10083734	molecular epidemiology of OMIM613825MESHC565165 heterozygotes with an arg95stop mutation of the c9 gene in japan. deficiency of the ninth component of human complement (c9) is the most common DOID626MESHD000081208 in japan, with an incidence of approximately one homozygote in 1000, but is very rare in other countries. genetic analyses of japanese OMIM613825MESHC565165 have shown that a c-to-t transition leading to tga stop codon for arg95 in exon 4 of the c9 gene (arg95stop) is common in japanese OMIM613825MESHC565165. to determine the prevalence of heterozygous carriers of the arg95stop mutation in a japanese population, we collected dna samples from 300 individuals in two of the four main islands of japan. heterozygote detection was performed with an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) system designed to detect exclusively only one of the normal and mutant alleles, followed by confirmation with pcr/single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis and direct sequencing. twenty individuals were heterozygous for the arg95stop mutation. none was homozygous. the prevalence of carriers of the arg95stop mutation was 6. 7% (20/300). an estimated frequency (0. 12%) of complete OMIM613825MESHC565165 due to homozygous arg95stop mutation was consistent with frequencies determined by serological studies 
2760209	molecular analysis of a female lesch-nyhan patient. we report the identification of a female patient with the x-linked recessive OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926 (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase [hprt] deficiency). cytogenetic and carrier studies revealed structurally normal chromosomes for this patient and her parents and demonstrated that this mutation arose through a de novo gametic event. comparison of this patients dna with the dna of her parents revealed that a microdeletion, which occurred within a maternal gamete and involved the entire hprt gene, was partially responsible for the DOID4MESHD004194 in this patient. somatic cell hybrids, generated to separate maternal and paternal x chromosomes, showed that expression of two additional x-linked enzymes, phosphoglycerate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, were expressed only in cells that contained the maternal x chromosome, suggesting the presence of a functionally inactive paternal x chromosome. furthermore, comparison of methylation patterns within a region of the hprt gene known to be important in gene regulation revealed differences between dna from the father and the patient, in keeping with an active hprt locus in the father and an inactive hprt locus in the patient. together these data indicate that nonrandom inactivation of the cytogenetically normal paternal x chromosome and a microdeletion of the hprt gene on an active maternal x chromosome were responsible for the absence of hprt in this patient.. 
10323252	changes at p183 of emerin weaken its protein-protein interactions resulting in x-linked emery-dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136. emery-dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136 (DOID11726) is an x-linked recessive DOID9884MESHD009136 characterized by early MESHD003286 of the elbows, achilles tendons and spine, slowly progressive DOID767 and weakness, and DOID0050700MESHD009202 associated with MESHD000075224. the emerin gene has been mapped to xq28 and encodes a 34-kda serine-rich protein, emerin, which has been localized to the nuclear envelope in a wide variety of tissues, including skeletal and cardiac muscle. mutations spanning the emerin gene have been identified in patients with DOID11726. we present here the effect, on emerin protein expression, of two missense mutations identified in unrelated DOID11726 patients. these alterations predict the replacement of a proline residue at position 183 with either a histidine or a threonine. biochemical analysis has demonstrated that the mobility and expression levels of the mutant forms of emerin are indistinguishable from that of wild-type emerin, but that they have weakened interactions with nuclear lamina components. in comparison with the usual DOID11726 phenotype, patients with p183 missense mutations have a later age at onset of first symptoms, elbow MESHD003286, ankle MESHD003286, upper limb weakness and lower limb weakness, but there is no difference for the age at onset of cardiac involvement. this is the first report of protein studies on patients with missense mutations resulting in the clinical features of DOID11726. these studies demonstrate the importance of proline 183 for the proper structure/function of emerin.. 
7795653	decreased expression of brca1 accelerates growth and is often present during sporadic OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 progression. we have characterized expression of the familial breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 gene, brca1, in cases of non-hereditary (sporadic) OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 and analyzed the effect of antisense inhibition of brca1 on the proliferative rate of mammary epithelial cells. brca1 mrna levels are markedly decreased during the transition from DOID8719MESHD002278 to invasive DOID162MESHD009369. experimental inhibition of brca1 expression with antisense oligonucleotides produced accelerated growth of normal and malignant mammary cells, but had no effect on non-mammary epithelial cells. these studies suggest that brca1 may normally serve as a negative regulator of mammary epithelial cell growth whose function is compromised in OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 either by direct mutation or alterations in gene expression.. 
10827108	additional copies of the proteolipid protein gene causing pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 arise by separate integration into the x chromosome. the proteolipid protein gene (plp) is normally present at chromosome xq22. mutations and duplications of this gene are associated with pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 (OMIM312080OMIM601186DOID3210OMIM169500MESHD020371). here we describe two new families in which males affected with OMIM312080OMIM601186DOID3210OMIM169500MESHD020371 were found to have a copy of plp on the short arm of the x chromosome, in addition to a normal copy on xq22. in the first family, the extra copy was first detected by the presence of heterozygosity of the ahaii dimorphism within the plp gene. the results of fish analysis showed an additional copy of plp in xp22. 1, although no chromosomal rearrangements could be detected by standard karyotype analysis. another three affected males from the family had similar findings. in a second unrelated family with signs of OMIM312080OMIM601186DOID3210OMIM169500MESHD020371, cytogenetic analysis showed a pericentric inversion of the x chromosome. in the inv (x) carried by several affected family members, fish showed plp signals at xp11. 4 and xq22. a third family has previously been reported, in which affected members had an extra copy of the plp gene detected at xq26 in a chromosome with an otherwise normal banding pattern. the identification of three separate families in which plp is duplicated at a noncontiguous site suggests that such duplications could be a relatively common but previously undetected cause of DOID630MESHD030342.
1975560	linkage relationships of the apolipoprotein c1 gene and a cytochrome p450 gene (cyp2a) to OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223. we have studied the genetic linkage of two markers, the apolipoprotein c1 (apoc1) gene and a cytochrome p450 (cyp2a) gene, in relation to the gene for OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm). a peak lod score of 9. 29 at 2 cm was observed for apoc1-dm, with a lod score of 8. 55 at 4 cm for cyp2a-dm. these two markers also show close linkage to each other (theta max = 0. 05, zmax = 9. 09). from examination of the genotypes of the recombinant individuals, cyp2a appears to map proximal to dm because in one recombinant individual cyp2a, apoc2 and ckmm had all recombined with dm. evidence from another cyp2a-dm recombinant individual places cyp2a proximal to apoc2 and ckmm. localisation of cyp2a on a panel of somatic cell hybrids also suggests that it is proximal to dm and apoc2/c1/e gene cluster. 
10737981	beta-galactosidase gene mutations affecting the lysosomal enzyme and the elastin-binding protein in gm1-DOID2368MESHD005733 patients with cardiac involvement. gm1-DOID2368MESHD005733 is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of acid beta-galactosidase (glb1). we report five new beta-galactosidase gene mutations in nine italian patients and one fetus, segregating in seven unrelated families. six of the eight patients with the infantile, severe form of the DOID4MESHD004194 presented cardiac involvement, a feature rarely associated with gm1-DOID2368MESHD005733. molecular analysis of the patients rna and dna identified two new rna splicing defects, three new and three previously described amino acid substitutions. interestingly, all patients with cardiac involvement were homozygous for one of these mutations  r59h, y591c, y591n, or ivs14-2a > g. in contrast, all other patients were compound heterozygous for one of the following mutations  r201h, r482h, g579d, ivs8 + 2t > c. although we could not directly correlate the presence of cardiac abnormalities with specific genetic lesions, the mutations identified in patients with DOID0050700MESHD009202 fell in the glb1 cdna region common to the lysosomal enzyme and the hbeta-gal-related protein, also known as the elastin binding protein (ebp). consequently, both molecules are affected by the mutations, and they may contribute differently to the occurrence of specific clinical manifestations.. 
1679035	exclusion of linkage between familial mediterranean MESHD005334 and the human serum amyloid a (saa) gene cluster. we studied the relationship between the autosomal recessive trait familial mediterranean MESHD005334 (OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505) and the serum amyloid a (saa) genes by comparing alleles of a highly polymorphic dinucleotide repeat and a conventional restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) in the saa gene cluster in israeli OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 kindreds. by haplotype analysis, our data indicate a minimum crossover frequency of 22% between the saa gene marker and OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505. by conventional linkage analysis this eliminates a minimum of 10. 4 cm including and surrounding the saa gene cluster as the site of the OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 mutation although saa proteins are prominent physiologic markers of the acute attacks. 
10802667	mice deficient in six5 develop MESHD002386: implications for OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223. expansion of a ctg trinucleotide repeat in the 3 utr of the gene dmpk at the OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 locus on chromosome 19 causes OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223, a dominantly inherited DOID4MESHD004194 characterized by skeletal muscle dystrophy and MESHD009222, MESHD002386 and MESHD000075224. targeted deletion of dm15, the mouse orthologue of human dmpk, produced mice with a mild DOID423MESHD009135 and cardiac conduction abnormalities, but without other features of OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223, such as MESHD009222 and MESHD002386. we, and others, have demonstrated that repeat expansion decreases expression of the adjacent gene six5 (refs 7, 8), which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor. to determine whether six5 deficiency contributes to the OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 phenotype, we disrupted mouse six5 by replacing the first exon with a beta-galactosidase reporter. six5-mutant mice showed reporter expression in multiple tissues, including the developing lens. homozygous mutant mice had no apparent abnormalities of skeletal muscle function, but developed lenticular opacities at a higher rate than controls. our results suggest that six5 deficiency contributes to the DOID83MESHD002386 phenotype in OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223, and that OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 represents a multigenic disorder.. 
1338764	screening for germ-line mutations in DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 patients: 61 new patients and a summary of 150 unrelated patients. we report here the result of a screening for germ-line mutations in the DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125) gene in 61 new DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM105210) patients as well as a summary of the results of 150 patients. examination of the entire coding region of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene, based on a ribonuclease protection assay coupled with the polymerase chain reaction (pcr), disclosed mutations that were considered to cause significant defects in the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 product in 97 of 150 unrelated OMIM105210 patients. our findings revealed the following characteristics of the germ-line mutations of OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125  1) the great majority of the mutations were found to truncate the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 product; 2) almost all of the mutations were located within the first half of the coding region; 3) no correlation was observed between the locations of germ-line mutations and extracolonic manifestations in OMIM105210 patients; 4) more than 80% of base substitutions in the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene were from cytosine to other nucleotides, nearly one-third of which occurred at the gpg site. our results provide information helpful to an understanding of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene and will also contribute to presymptomatic diagnosis of members in OMIM105210 families.. 
1999552	hereditary deficiency of c5 in association with discoid DOID8857. a 29-year-old woman with discoid DOID8857 had undetectable classic pathway complement activity. hypocomplementemia was due to selective deficiency of c5. one of her children was also deficient. to our knowledge this is the first documented case of an association between discoid DOID8857 and OMIM609536DOID8158MESHC537005.. 
10818206	isolation, genomic organization, and expression analysis of the mouse and rat homologs of mefv, the gene for familial mediterranean MESHD005334. familial mediterranean MESHD005334 (OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of MESHD005334 with MESHD012700 or DOID2703DOID12225MESHD013585. recently the OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 gene (mefv) was cloned; the protein product, pyrin/marenostrin, is thought to regulate MESHD007249 in myeloid cells. in this manuscript we report the mouse and rat homologs of mefv. the murine gene contains ten exons with a coding sequence of 2304 bp, while the rat homolog has nine exons with a coding sequence of 2253 bp. a considerable amino acid sequence homology was observed between the mouse and human (47. 6% identity and 65. 5% similarity) and between the mouse and rat genes (73. 5% identity and 82. 1% similarity). the predicted rodent proteins have several important domains and signals found in human pyrin, including a b-box zinc finger domain, robbins-dingwall nuclear localization signal, and coiled-coil domain. however, perhaps because of an ancient frame-shift mutation, neither the mouse nor the rat protein has an intact c-terminal b30. 2 domain, in which most OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505-associated mutations have been found in human mefv. nevertheless, like the human gene, mouse mefv is expressed in peripheral blood granulocytes but not lymphocytes. consistent with its expression in granulocytes, mefv was detected at high levels in the primary follicles and marginal zones of the splenic white pulp. mefv is localized on mouse chromosome (OMIM118840OMIM214100) 16, region a3-b1, extending a region of synteny with human OMIM118840OMIM214100 16p13. 3. development of knockout and knockin mouse models may provide further insights into the functional evolution of this gene. 
1684569	analysis of x-chromosome inactivation and presumptive expression of the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 (was) gene in hematopoietic cell lineages of a thrombocytopenic carrier female of was. we report on a thrombocytopenic female belonging to a pedigree with the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 (was). restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis with probe m27 beta, closely linked to the was gene, demonstrated that she is a carrier of was. both small-sized and normal-sized platelets were present, suggesting that, unlike the vast majority of was carriers, she does not manifest nonrandom x-chromosome inactivation in the thrombopoietic cell lineage. study of x-chromosome inactivation by means of rflp and methylation analysis demonstrated that the pattern of x-chromosome inactivation was nonrandom in t lymphocytes, but random in granulocytes. while this is the first complete report on the occurrence of DOID1588MESHD013921 in a carrier female of was as the result of atypical lyonization, it also suggests that expression of the was gene occurs at (or extends up to) a later stage than the multipotent stem cell along the hematopoietic differentiation pathway.. 
10724175	hcds1-mediated phosphorylation of brca1 regulates the dna damage response. mutations in the brca1 (ref. 1) tumour suppressor gene are found in almost all of the families with inherited breast and DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051 and about half of the families with only OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943. although the biochemical function of brca1 is not well understood, it is important for dna damage repair and cell-cycle checkpoint. brca1 exists in nuclear foci but is hyperphosphorylated and disperses after dna damage. it is not known whether brca1 phosphorylation and dispersion and its function in dna damage response are related. in yeast the dna damage response and the replication-block checkpoint are mediated partly through the cds1 kinase family. here we report that the human cds1 kinase (hcds1/chk2) regulates brca1 function after dna damage by phosphorylating serine 988 of brca1. we show that hcds1 and brca1 interact and co-localize within discrete nuclear foci but separate after gamma irradiation. phosphorylation of brca1 at serine 988 is required for the release of brca1 from hcds1. this phosphorylation is also important for the ability of brca1 to restore survival after dna damage in the brca1-mutated cell line hcc1937.. 
10556285	ataxin-3 with an altered conformation that exposes the polyglutamine domain is associated with the nuclear matrix.

10077614	a zinc finger truncation of murine OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 results in the characteristic MESHD014564 of OMIM194080DOID3764MESHD030321 . the wilms DOID162MESHD009369 -suppressor gene, OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396, plays a key role in urogenital development, and OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 dysfunction is implicated in both neoplastic (wilms DOID162MESHD009369, DOID2645MESHD008654, DOID1240MESHD007938, and OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943) and nonneoplastic (DOID0050851) DOID4MESHD004194. the analysis of DOID4MESHD004194MESHC linked specifically with OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 mutations, such as OMIM194080DOID3764MESHD030321 (OMIM194080OMIM304700DOID3764MESHD030321DOID0050757MESHC535808), can provide valuable insight concerning the role of OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 in development and DOID4MESHD004194. OMIM194080OMIM304700DOID3764MESHD030321DOID0050757MESHC535808 is a rare childhood DOID4MESHD004194 characterized by a DOID557 involving mesangial MESHD012598, xy DOID3765DOID1923DOID3763MESHD012734, and/or wilms DOID162MESHD009369 (wt). OMIM194080OMIM304700DOID3764MESHD030321DOID0050757MESHC535808 patients are constitutionally heterozygous for exonic point mutations in OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396, which include mutations predicted to truncate the protein within the c-terminal zinc finger (zf) region. we report that heterozygosity for a targeted murine OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 allele, OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 (tmt396), which truncates zf3 at codon 396, induces mesangial MESHD012598 characteristic of OMIM194080OMIM304700DOID3764MESHD030321DOID0050757MESHC535808 in adult heterozygous and chimeric mice. male genital defects also were evident and there was a single case of wilms DOID162MESHD009369 in which the transcript of the nontargeted allele showed an exon 9 skipping event, implying a causal link between OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 dysfunction and wilms MESHD063646 in mice. however, the mutant OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 (tmt396) protein accounted for only 5% of OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 in both heterozygous embryonic stem cells and the wt. this has implications regarding the mechanism by which the mutant allele exerts its effect.
7106752	heterogeneity of "mediterranean type" glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency in spain and description of two new variants associated with DOID13628MESHD005236. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd); ec 1. 1. 1. 49 from thirty-six unrelated spanish males was partially purified from blood, and the variants were characterized biochemically and electrophoretically according to the methods recommended by the world health organization. subjects were from multiple geographic regions within spain, and all suffered from hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740, either acute (34 cases) or chronic nonspherocytic (2 cases). almost all the variants studied presented residual erythrocyte g6pd activity ranging from 0 to 10% of normal, and five different mutants were responsible for the deficient phenotype. three variants were similar to others previously described  g6pd mediterranean (11 cases), g6pd athens-like (3 cases), and g6pd union (2 cases). the remaining variants were different from the numerous variants already reported and have been considered as new mutants. provisionally they are called g6pd betica (19 cases) and g6pd menorca (1 case). the present study constitutes the first attempt to characterize the deficient g6pd variants found in spain and supplies new data on the relationship between molecular characteristics of deficient variants and their clinical manifestations. the most important findings can be summarized as follows  (1) the spanish population is characterized by an important heterogeneity in DOID2862MESHD005955. (2) although g6pd mediterranean is very frequent, it presents a relatively high degree of polymorphism. (3) DOID13628MESHD005236 has been observed associated with all kinds of variants described here. (4) g6pd betica, which is the most frequent variant found in subjects of southern spanish origin, has been observed associated with DOID13628MESHD005236 in all cases except one. 
10480214	early onset of x-linked emery-dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136 in a boy with emerin gene deletion. a boy developed MESHD003286 of the achilles tendons at 3 years and of the postcervical muscles at 7 years, although neither MESHD003286 of the elbows nor cardiac abnormality were recognized by the age of 9 years. muscle computed tomography scanning revealed changes characteristic of muscle involvement. emerin was not detected in the biopsied muscle, and rt-pcr and pcr-based genomic dna analyses of the emerin gene demonstrated no amplification product in the patient. these results confirmed the diagnosis of x-linked emery-dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136 (DOID11726), and reinforce the necessity of molecular genetic diagnosis of the membrane protein emerin in younger patients with possible DOID11726 before appearance of the typical symptoms, to avoid sudden MESHD003643.. 
1682919	prad1, a candidate bcl1 oncogene: mapping and expression in centrocytic DOID0060058MESHD008223. rearrangement of the bcl1 (DOID707MESHD016393 1) region on chromosome 11q13 appears to be highly characteristic of centrocytic DOID0060058MESHD008223 and also is found infrequently in other b-cell DOID162MESHD009369. rearrangement is thought to deregulate a nearby protooncogene, but transcribed sequences in the immediate vicinity of bcl1 breakpoints had not been identified. prad1, previously designated d11s287e, was identified on 11q13 as a chromosomal breakpoint region rearranged with the parathyroid hormone gene in a subset of parathyroid DOID657DOID3172DOID5403DOID6204MESHD000236; this highly conserved putative oncogene, which encodes a novel cyclin, has been linked to bcl1 and implicated also in subsets of breast and squamous cell DOID162MESHD009369 with 11q13 amplification. we report pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data showing bcl1 and prad1 to be no more than 130 kilobases apart. prad1 mrna is abundantly expressed in seven of seven centrocytic DOID0060058MESHD008223 (kiel classification), in contrast to 13 closely related but noncentrocytic DOID0060058MESHD008223. three of the seven centrocytic DOID0060058MESHD008223 had detectable bcl1 dna rearrangement. also, two unusual cases of OMIM151400DOID1036DOID1040OMIM109543OMIM609630OMIM612557OMIM612558OMIM612559MESHD015451 with bcl1 rearrangement overexpressed prad1, in contrast to five OMIM151400DOID1036DOID1040OMIM109543OMIM609630OMIM612557OMIM612558OMIM612559MESHD015451 controls. thus, prad1 is an excellent candidate " bcl1 oncogene. " its overexpression may be a key consequence of rearrangement of the bcl1 vicinity in b-cell DOID162MESHD009369 and a unifying pathogenetic feature in centrocytic DOID0060058MESHD008223. 
7202134	OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326: increased plasma content of saturated very long chain fatty acids. with a new method we measured the saturated very long chain fatty acids in the plasma of OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326) hemizygotes, OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 heterozygotes, and controls. OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 hemizygotes showed increased levels of hexacosanoate (c26 fatty acid) which represented 0. 081 +/- 0. 0066% (sem) of total fatty acids, compared to 0. 015 +/- 0. 0032% in the controls. c25, c24, and c23 fatty acids were also increased, but the c22 and c20 fatty acids were normal. c26 levels were also increased in most OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 heterozygotes, with a mean level 0. 057 +/- 0. 0063% of total fatty acids. the technique can be used for diagnosis and carrier identification, and in the evaluation of therapy.
6337374	DOID2862MESHD005955 inhibits in vitro growth of plasmodium falciparum. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd; ec 1. 1. 1. 49) -deficient red blood cells from male hemizygotes and female heterozygotes from the island of sardinia were studied for their ability to support growth in vitro of the DOID12365OMIM609148OMIM611162MESHD008288-causing organism plasmodium falciparum. parasite growth was approximately one-third of normal in both hemi- and heterozygotes for DOID2862MESHD005955. in sardinians with the beta 0-DOID10241MESHD013789 trait, parasite growth was normal except when DOID2862MESHD005955 occurred together with the DOID10241MESHD013789 trait. the data support the hypothesis that DOID2862MESHD005955 may confer a selective advantage in a malarious area; the female heterozygote may be at a particular advantage because resistance to DOID12365OMIM609148OMIM611162MESHD008288 equals that of male hemizygotes, but the risk of fatal MESHD006461 may be less. however, more female heterozygotes must be studied to confirm this hypothesis. no protective effect of beta 0-DOID10241MESHD013789 trait could be demonstrated in vitro.

2963536	inherited DOID8354 with recurrent MESHD007239 and DOID2921MESHD005921. a 10-year-old laotian boy had homozygous deficiency of the third component of complement and recurrent DOID104MESHD001424 beginning at age 5 months. cellular and humoral immunity were normal, as were polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis and bactericidal activities. serum complement-mediated hemolytic, chemotactic, and opsonic activities were deficient. in vitro addition of purified c3 to patient serum restored hemolytic complement to normal levels, and plasma infusion during each of four episodes of DOID552MESHD011014 significantly enhanced serum opsonic activity for as long as 36 hours. a renal biopsy specimen revealed mesangiopathic DOID2921MESHD005921, although significant levels of circulating igg immune complexes were not detected. these findings further support the association of DOID8354 with immune-complex DOID4MESHD004194 and suggest that plasma infusion may be an adjunct to antibiotic therapy in the management of severe pyogenic MESHD007239 in patients with DOID8354.. 
7586656	southern analysis reveals a large deletion at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase locus in a patient with OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926. whole genomic hprt clones were used in southern analysis to screen the integrity of the hprt gene in a family that includes a patient with hprt enzyme deficiency causal to OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926. a 5 kb dna sequence deletion was found to have its endpoints in the first and third introns. the probes identified the carrier status of female family members, aided by an rflp carried by the mothers normal x-chromosome.. 
10426999	association of brca1 with the hrad50-hmre11-p95 complex and the dna damage response. brca1 encodes a DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor that is mutated in familial breast and DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051. here, it is shown that brca1 interacts in vitro and in vivo with hrad50, which forms a complex with hmre11 and p95/nibrin. upon irradiation, brca1 was detected in discrete foci in the nucleus, which colocalize with hrad50. formation of irradiation-induced foci positive for brca1, hrad50, hmre11, or p95 was dramatically reduced in OMIM114550MESHD006528/1937 OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 cells carrying a homozygous mutation in brca1 but was restored by transfection of wild-type brca1. ectopic expression of wild-type, but not mutated, brca1 in these cells rendered them less sensitive to the dna damage agent, methyl methanesulfonate. these data suggest that brca1 is important for the cellular responses to dna damage that are mediated by the hrad50-hmre11-p95 complex.. 
3678494	nebulin and titin expression in duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 appears normal. monoclonal antibodies which recognize different epitopes on either titin or nebulin show normal staining patterns on frozen sections of three muscle biopsies of duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388). gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting performed on two of these muscle biopsies show the normal pattern of titin and nebulin polypeptides. since the donor of one of these biopsies has a large deletion of the 5-region of the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene, our results argue against the recent proposal that nebulin is the gene mutated in OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388.. 
8281152	OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 kinase is a component of neuromuscular junctions. the clinical manifestation of OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) is correlated to the extent of expansion of an unstable [ctg] n dna motif. recent studies have demonstrated that this trinucleotide motif forms part of the last, 3 untranslated exon of a gene which potentially encodes multiple protein isoforms of a serine/threonine protein kinase (OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 protein kinase, dm-pk). we report here on the development of antisera against synthetic dm-pk peptide antigens and their use in biochemical and histochemical studies. immunoreactive dm-kinase protein of 53 kd is present at low levels in skeletal and cardiac muscle extracts of dm patients and normal controls. immunohistochemical staining revealed that dm-pk is localised prominently at sites of neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions (nmjs and mtjs) of human and rodent skeletal muscles. furthermore, very low levels of immunoreactive dm-pk protein are present in the sarcoplasm of predominantly type i fibres in various muscles. strikingly, presence of the protein can also be demonstrated for nmjs of muscular tissues of adult and congenital cases of dm, with no gross changes in structural organisation. our findings provide a basis for further characterisation of the role of the kinase in protein assembly processes or signal mediation at synaptic sites and ultimately for the understanding of the complex pathophysiology of dm.. 
7316485	new genetic variants of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) in italy. six new variants of human erythrocyte g6pd have been characterized. all of them were found in italian males and all were associated with enzyme deficiency, but only two with signs of MESHD006461. these and other variants reported in the literature, which must thus far be regarded as sporadic, are found to map in parts of italy where common types of DOID2862MESHD005955 are also prevalent.. 
10677309	atm-heterozygous germline mutations contribute to OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943-susceptibility. approximately 0. 5% -1% of the general population has been estimated to be heterozygous for a germline mutation in the atm gene. mutations in the atm gene are responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 (a-t) (mim 208900). the finding that atm-heterozygotes have an increased relative risk for OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 was supported by some studies but not confirmed by others. in view of this discrepancy, we examined the frequency of atm germline mutations in a selected group of dutch patients with OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943. we have analyzed atm germline mutations in normal blood lymphocytes, using the protein-truncation test followed by genomic-sequence analysis. a high percentage of atm germline mutations was demonstrated among patients with sporadic OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943. the 82 patients OMIM612069MESHC567429OMIM606217MESHC565249OMIM115197MESHC566169DOID0110552OMIM606346DOID0110494OMIM609006OMIM300123MESHC567485DOID0111806OMIM610125MESHC566441DOID0110927OMIM161800OMIM611590MESHC566910OMIM613750MESHC563526 in this study had developed OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 at age < 45 and had survived >/= 5 years (mean 15 years), and in 33 (40%) of the patients a contralateral breast DOID162MESHD009369 had been diagnosed. among these patients we identified seven (8. 5%) atm germline mutations, of which five are distinct. one splice-site mutation (ivs10-6t-- > g) was detected three times in our series. four heterozygous carriers were patients with bilateral OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943. our results indicate that the mutations identified in this study are " a-t DOID4MESHD004194-causing " mutations that might be associated with an increased risk of OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 in heterozygotes. we conclude that atm heterozygotes have an approximately ninefold-increased risk of developing a type of OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 characterized by frequent bilateral occurrence, early age at onset, and long-term survival. the specific characteristics of our population of patients may explain why such a high frequency was not found in other series. 
10709732	OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735 (OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735) in a child from consanguineous parents: a dominant or recessive DOID4MESHD004194? OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735 (OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735) is characterized by autoimmune features and lymphoproliferations and is generally caused by defective fas-mediated apoptosis. this report describes a child with clinical features of OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735 without detectable fas expression on freshly isolated blood leukocytes. detection of fas transcripts via real-time quantitative pcr made a severe transcriptional OMIM188560 unlikely. sequencing of the fas gene revealed a 20-nucleotide duplication in the last exon affecting the cytoplasmic signaling domain. the patient was homozygous for this mutation, whereas the consanguineous parents and the siblings were heterozygous. the patient reported here is a human homologue of the fas-null mouse, inasmuch as she carries an autosomal homozygous mutation in the fas gene and she shows the severe and accelerated OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735 phenotype. the heterozygous family members did not have the OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735 phenotype, indicating that the DOID4MESHD004194-causing fas mutation in this family is autosomal recessive.. 
8551426	a prevalent mutation for DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 among black americans. objective  to define the mutation causing DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 in patients of black american origin who have no galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (galt) activity in erythrocytes but good clinical outcome. methods  we discovered a mutation caused by a c-- > t transition at base-pair 1158 of the galt gene that results in a serine-to-leucine substitution at codon 135 (s135l). we developed a method with which to screen populations for its prevalence. we compared galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase among erythrocytes, leukocytes, and transformed lymphoblasts, as well as total body oxidation of d- (13c) -galactose to 13co2 among three genotypes for galt (s135l/s135l, q188r/q188r, and normal/normal). results  we found a 48% prevalence of the s135l mutation among 17 black american patients with classic DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 and a 1% prevalence in a population of 50 black americans without DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693. the s135l mutation was not found in 84 white patients with g/g DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 nor in 87 white control subjects without DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693. we found normal whole body oxidation of d- (13c) -galactose by the patient homozygous for s135l and various degrees of enzyme impairment among different tissues. conclusions  the s135l mutation in the galt gene is a prevalent cause of DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 among black patients. because galt activity varies in different tissues of patients homozygous for s135l, they may have a better clinical outcome than patients who are homozygous for q188r when both are treated from infancy.. 
10699184	constitutive and regulated modes of splicing produce six major OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 protein kinase (dmpk) isoforms with distinct properties. OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) is the most prevalent inherited DOID440MESHD009468 in adults. the genetic OMIM188560 is a ctg triplet repeat expansion in the 3-untranslated region of the OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 protein kinase (dmpk) gene, consisting of 15 exons. using a transgenic dmpk-overexpressor mouse model, we demonstrate here that the endogenous mouse dmpk gene and the human dmpk transgene produce six major alternatively spliced mrnas which have almost identical cell type-dependent distribution frequencies and expression patterns. use of a cryptic 5 splice site in exon 8, which results in absence or presence of 15 nucleotides specifying a vsggg peptide motif, and/or use of a cryptic 3 splice site in exon 14, which leads to a frameshift in the mrna reading frame, occur as independent stochastic events in all tissues examined. in contrast, the excision of exons 13/14 that causes a frameshift and creates a c-terminally truncated protein is clearly cell type dependent and occurs predominantly in smooth muscle. we generated all six full-length mouse cdnas that result from combinations of these three major splicing events and show that their transfection into cells in culture leads to production of four different approximately 74 kda full-length (heart-, skeletal muscle- or brain-specific) and two c-terminally truncated approximately 68 kda (smooth muscle-specific) isoforms. information on dmpk mrna and protein isoform expression patterns will be useful for recognizing differential effects of (ctg) (n) expansion in dm manifestation.. 
10417286	linkage analysis in a large brazilian family with DOID0060239OMIM119300MESHC536528 suggests the existence of a susceptibility locus for OMIM119540DOID674MESHD002972MESHC566991 at 17p11.2-11.1. DOID0060239OMIM119300MESHC536528 (vws), which has been mapped to 1q32-41, is characterized by pits and/or sinuses of the lower DOID9296MESHD002971 OMIM247610/palate (cl/p), OMIM119540DOID674MESHD002972MESHC566991 (cp), bifid uvula, and DOID0050591OMIM106600MESHD000848 (h). the expression of vws, which has incomplete penetrance, is highly variable. both the occurrence of cl/p and cp within the same genealogy and a MESHD012008 risk < 40% for cp among descendants with vws have suggested that the development of clefts in this DOID225MESHD013577 is influenced by modifying genes at other loci. to test this hypothesis, we have conducted linkage analysis in a large brazilian kindred with vws, considering as affected the individuals with cp, regardless of whether it is associated with other clinical signs of vws. our results suggest that a gene at 17p11. 2-11 2-11. 1, together with the vws gene at 1p32-41, enhances the probability of cp in an individual carrying the two at-risk genes. if this hypothesis is confirmed in other vws pedigrees, it will represent one of the first examples of a gene, mapped through linkage analysis, which modifies the expression of a major gene. 
3393536	diverse point mutations in the human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene cause enzyme deficiency and mild or severe hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd; ec 1. 1. 1. 49) deficiency is a common genetic abnormality affecting an estimated 400 million people worldwide. clinical and biochemical analyses have identified many variants exhibiting a range of phenotypes, which have been well characterized from the hematological point of view. however, until now, their precise molecular basis has remained unknown. we have cloned and sequenced seven mutant g6pd alleles. in the nondeficient polymorphic african variant g6pd a we have found a single point mutation. the other six mutants investigated were all associated with enzyme deficiency. in one of the commonest, g6pd mediterranean, which is associated with DOID13628MESHD005236 among other clinical manifestations, a single amino acid replacement was found (serine----phenylalanine)  it must be responsible for the decreased stability and the reduced catalytic efficiency of this enzyme. single point mutations were also found in g6pd metaponto (southern italy) and in g6pd ilesha (nigeria), which are asymptomatic, and in g6pd chatham, which was observed in an indian boy with DOID2383MESHD007567. in g6pd " matera, " which is now known to be the same as g6pd a-, two separate point mutations were found, one of which is the same as in g6pd a. in g6pd santiago, a de novo mutation (glycine----arginine) is associated with severe chronic hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740. the mutations observed show a striking predominance of c----t transitions, with cg doublets involved in four of seven cases. thus, diverse point mutations may account largely for the phenotypic heterogeneity of DOID2862MESHD005955. 
2215607	increased high-density lipoprotein levels caused by a common cholesteryl-ester transfer protein gene mutation. background and methods. the plasma cholesteryl-ester transfer protein (cetp) catalyzes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein (hdl) to other lipoproteins. we recently described a japanese family with increased hdl levels and OMIM143470DOID0111369MESHC564591 due to a splicing OMIM188560 of the cetp gene. to assess the frequency and phenotype of this condition, we screened 11 additional families with high hdl levels by means of a radioimmunoassay for cetp and dna analysis. results. we found the same cetp gene mutation in four families from three different regions of japan. analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms of the mutant cetp allele showed that all probands were homozygous for the identical haplotype. family members homozygous for OMIM143470DOID0111369MESHC564591 (n = 10) had moderate MESHD006937 (mean total cholesterol level [+/- sd], 7. 01 +/- 0. 83 mmol per liter), markedly increased levels of hdl cholesterol (4. 24 +/- 1. 01 mmol per liter) and apolipoprotein a-i, and decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1. 99 +/- 0. 80 mmol per liter) and apolipoprotein b. members heterozygous for the deficiency (n = 20), whose cetp levels were in the lower part of the normal range, had moderately increased levels of hdl cholesterol and apolipoprotein a-i and an increased ratio of hdl subclass 2 to hdl subclass 3, as compared with unaffected family members (1. 5 +/- 0. 8 vs. 0. 7 +/- 0. 4). OMIM143470DOID0111369MESHC564591 was not found in six unrelated subjects with elevated hdl cholesterol levels who were from different parts of the united states. conclusions. OMIM143470DOID0111369MESHC564591 appears to be a frequent cause of increased hdl levels in the population of japan, possibly because of a founder effect. the results that we observed in heterozygotes suggest that cetp normally plays a part in the regulation of levels of hdl subclass 2. there was no evidence of premature DOID1936DOID2348OMIM108725MESHD050197 in the families with OMIM143470DOID0111369MESHC564591. in fact, the lipoprotein profile of persons with OMIM143470DOID0111369MESHC564591 is potentially antiatherogenic and may be associated with an increased life span.  
7523157	hereditary deficiency of the seventh component of complement and recurrent MESHD008589: investigations of an irish family using a novel haemolytic screening assay for complement activity and c7 m/n allotyping. terminal complement component deficiency predisposes to MESHD008589 and is inherited in an autosomal co-dominant manner. an irish family is described, in which 2 of 3 brothers had recurrent MESHD008589. a novel screening assay was used to investigate for terminal DOID626MESHD000081208 and the 2 affected brothers were found to be completely deficient in the seventh component of complement (c7). enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for c7 revealed lower than normal levels in the remaining brother and parents. c7 m/n protein polymorphism allotyping, used to investigate the segregation of the OMIM610102MESHC566443 genes, showed that the apparently complement sufficient brother was heterozygous c7 deficient and a carrier of one of the deficiency genes. complement screening should be carried out in any individual suffering recurrent MESHD008589 or MESHD007239 with an uncommon meningococcal serogroup. identification of complement deficient patients allows the implementation of strategies to prevent recurrent MESHD007239.. 
3162536	mild and severe DOID9884MESHD009136 associated with deletions in xp21 of the human x chromosome. we have analysed over 300 patients suffering from duchenne or becker DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 or OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826). deletions have been characterised which encompass either the pert87 (dxs164) locus only, the xj1. 1 (dxs206) and hip25 loci only, or all three loci. these loci have been shown to lie within the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 region covering several hundred kilobases (kb) of dna. one mildly affected OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826 patient possesses a deletion of at least 110 kb including exons of the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene. other patients with similar exon deletions, or smaller deletions, show the more severe phenotype typical of OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388. we conclude from these studies that the severity of the clinical phenotype cannot be explained on the basis of the size of the deletion. we discuss this in the context of candidate gene sequences. 
10631148	meiotic segregation analysis of OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 alleles in OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 pedigrees by use of single-sperm typing. in DOID4648DOID768OMIM180200MESHD012175, different epidemiological studies have indicated a preferential paternal transmission of mutant OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 alleles to offspring, suggesting the occurrence of a meiotic drive. to investigate this mechanism, we analyzed sperm samples from six individuals from five unrelated families affected with DOID4648DOID768OMIM180200MESHD012175. single-sperm typing techniques were performed for each sample by study of two informative short tandem repeats located either in or close to the OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 gene (OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175). the segregation probability of mutant OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 alleles in sperm samples was assessed by use of the spermseg program, which includes experimental parameters, recombination fractions between the markers, and segregation parameters. a total of 2, 952 single sperm from the six donors were analyzed. we detected a significant segregation distortion in the data as a whole (p =. 0099) and a significant heterogeneity in the segregation rate across donors (. 0092). further analysis shows that this result can be explained by segregation distortion in favor of the normal allele in one donor only and that it does not provide evidence of a significant segregation distortion in the other donors. the segregation distortion favoring the mutant OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 allele does not seem to occur during spermatogenesis, and, thus, meiotic drive may result either from various mechanisms, including a fertilization advantage or a better mobility in sperm bearing a mutant OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 gene, or from the existence of a defectively imprinted gene located on the human x chromosome.

1353340	late-onset OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966: molecular pathology in two siblings. we report on a new allele at the arylsulfatase a (arsa) locus causing late-onset OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 (OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966). in that allele arginine84, a residue that is highly conserved in the arylsulfatase gene family, is replaced by glutamine. in contrast to alleles that cause early-onset OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966, the arginine84 to glutamine substitution is associated with some residual arsa activity. a comparison of genotypes, arsa activities, and clinical data on 4 individuals carrying the allele of 81 patients with OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 examined, further validates the concept that different degrees of residual arsa activity are the basis of phenotypical variation in OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966.. 
10200300	defective cd95/apo-1/fas signal complex formation in the human MESHC566613. heterozygous mutations in the cd95 (apo-1/fas) receptor occur in most individuals with OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735 (OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735) and dominantly interfere with apoptosis by an unknown mechanism. we show that local or global alterations in the structure of the cytoplasmic MESHD003643 domain from nine independent OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735 cd95 MESHD003643-domain mutations result in a failure to bind the fadd/mort1 signaling protein. despite heterozygosity for the abnormal allele, lymphocytes from OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735 patients showed markedly decreased fadd association and a loss of caspase recruitment and activation after cd95 crosslinking. these data suggest that intracytoplasmic cd95 mutations in OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735 impair apoptosis chiefly by disrupting MESHD003643-domain interactions with the signaling protein fadd/mort1..

1380672	uncoupling of hypomyelination and glial cell MESHD003643 by a mutation in the proteolipid protein gene. proteolipid protein (plp; m (r) 30, 000) is a highly conserved major polytopic membrane protein in myelin but its cellular function remains obscure. neurological mutant mice can often provide model systems for human DOID630MESHD030342 . mutations of the x-chromosome-linked plp gene are lethal, identified first in the jimpy mouse and subsequently in patients with pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194. the unexplained phenotype of these mutations includes degeneration and premature cell MESHD003643 of oligodendrocytes with associated hypomyelination. here we show that a new mouse mutant rumpshaker is defined by the amino-acid substitution ile-to-thr at residue 186 in a membrane-embedded domain of plp. surprisingly, rumpshaker mice, although myelin-deficient, have normal longevity and a full complement of morphologically normal oligodendrocytes. hypomyelination can thus be genetically separated from the plp-dependent oligodendrocyte degeneration. we suggest that plp has a vital function in glial cell development, distinct from its later role in myelin assembly, and that this dichotomy of action may explain the clinical spectrum of pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194.. 
10594001	mutational analysis of the hgo gene in finnish OMIM203500DOID9270MESHD000474 patients. OMIM203500DOID9270MESHD000474 (OMIM203500MESHD000474), the prototypic inborn error of metabolism, has recently been shown to be caused by loss of function mutations in the homogentisate-1, 2-dioxygenase gene (hgo). so far 17 mutations have been characterised in OMIM203500MESHD000474 patients of different ethnic origin. we describe three novel mutations (r58fs, r330s, and h371r) and one common OMIM203500MESHD000474 mutation (m368v), detected by mutational and polymorphism analysis of the hgo gene in five finnish OMIM203500MESHD000474 pedigrees. the three novel OMIM203500MESHD000474 mutations are most likely specific for the finnish population and have originated recently.. 
8441467	putative DOID10588OMIM300100MESHD000326 gene shares unexpected homology with abc transporters. OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326) is an x-linked DOID4MESHD004194 affecting 1/20, 000 males either as cerebral OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 in childhood or as OMIM300100MESHD000326 (amn) in adults. childhood OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 is the more severe form, with onset of neurological symptoms between 5-12 years of age. central nervous system DOID3213MESHD003711 progresses rapidly and MESHD003643 occurs within a few years. amn is a milder form of the DOID4MESHD004194 with onset at 15-30 years of age and a more progressive course. MESHD000309 (DOID13774MESHD000224) may remain the only clinical manifestation of OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326. the principal biochemical abnormality of OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 is the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids (vlcfa) because of impaired beta-oxidation in peroxisomes. the normal oxidation of vlcfa-coa in patients fibroblasts suggested that the gene coding for the vlcfa-coa synthetase could be a candidate gene for OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326. here we use positional cloning to identify a gene partially deleted in 6 of 85 independent patients with OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326. in familial cases, the deletions segregated with the DOID4MESHD004194. an identical deletion was detected in two brothers presenting with different clinical OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 phenotypes. candidate exons were identified by computer analysis of genomic sequences and used to isolate complementary dnas by exon connection and screening of cdna libraries. the deduced protein sequence shows significant sequence identity to a peroxisomal membrane protein of m (r) 70k that is involved in peroxisome biogenesis and belongs to the atp-binding cassette superfamily of transporters..

OMIM274600DOID0060744MESHC536648 comprises congenital DOID10003MESHD006319, thyroid DOID12176MESHD006042, and positive perchlorate discharge test. recently, this autosomal recessive disorder was shown to be caused by mutations in the OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648 gene, which encodes an anion transporter called pendrin. molecular analysis of the OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648 gene was performed in two consanguineous large families from southern tunisia comprising a total of 23 individuals affected with profound congenital MESHD003638; the same missense mutation, l445w, was identified in all affected individuals. a widened vestibular aqueduct was found in all patients who underwent computed tomography (ct) scan exploration of the inner ear. in contrast, DOID12176MESHD006042 was present in only 11 affected individuals, who interestingly had a normal result of the perchlorate discharge test whenever performed. the present results question the sensitivity of the perchlorate test for the diagnosis of OMIM274600DOID0060744MESHC536648 and support the use of a molecular analysis of the OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648 gene in the assessment of individuals with severe to profound congenital MESHD034381 associated with inner ear morphological anomaly even in the absence of a thyroid DOID12176MESHD006042.. 
10470088	the type of somatic mutation at OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 in DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 is determined by the site of the germline mutation: a new facet to knudson's 'two-hit' hypothesis. OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 is often cited as a prime example of a DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor gene. truncating germline and somatic mutations (or, infrequently, allelic loss) occur in DOID162MESHD009369 in OMIM105210 (DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125). most sporadic DOID9256OMIM114500OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 also have two OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutations. clues from attenuated polyposis, missense germline variants with mild DOID4MESHD004194 and the somatic mutation cluster region (codons 1, 250-1, 450) indicate, however, that OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutations might not result in simple loss of protein function. we have found that OMIM105210 patients with germline OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutations within a small region (codons 1, 194-1, 392 at most) mainly show allelic loss in their colorectal DOID657DOID3172DOID5403DOID6204MESHD000236, in contrast to other OMIM105210 patients, whose second hits tend to occur by truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region. our results indicate that different OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutations provide cells with different selective advantages, with mutations close to codon 1, 300 providing the greatest advantage. allelic loss is selected strongly in cells with one mutation near codon 1, 300. a different germline-somatic OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutation association exists in OMIM105210 MESHD018222. OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 is not, therefore, a classical DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor. our findings also indicate a new mechanism for DOID4MESHD004194 severity  if a broader spectrum of mutations is selected in DOID162MESHD009369, the somatic mutation rate is effectively higher and more DOID162MESHD009369 grow.. 
7769092	purification of human very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase and characterization of its deficiency in seven patients. mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase (vlcad) was purified from human liver. the molecular masses of the native enzyme and the subunit were estimated to be 154 and 70 kd, respectively. the enzyme was found to catalyze the major part of mitochondrial palmitoylcoenzyme a dehydrogenation in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and skin fibroblasts (89-97, 86-99, 96-99, and 78-87%, respectively). skin fibroblasts from 26 patients suspected of having a disorder of mitochondrial beta-oxidation were analyzed for vlcad protein using immunoblotting, and 7 of them contained undetectable or trace levels of the enzyme. the seven deficient fibroblast lines were characterized by measuring acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenation activities, overall palmitic acid oxidation, and vlcad protein synthesis using pulse-chase, further confirming the diagnosis of OMIM201475MESHC536353. these results suggested the heterogenous nature of the mutations causing the deficiency in the seven patients. clinically, all patients with OMIM201475MESHC536353 exhibited DOID114MESHD006331. at least four of them presented with hypertrophic DOID0050700MESHD009202. this frequency (> 57%) was much higher than that observed in patients with other disorders of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation that may be accompanied by DOID114MESHD006331 in infants.. 
1282899	a germ line mutation within the coding sequence for the putative 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate binding site of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) in a lesch-nyhan patient: missense mutations within a functionally important region probably cause DOID4MESHD004194. OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926 caused by a complete deficiency of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) is the result of a heterogeneous group of germ line mutations. identification of each mutant gene provides valuable information as to the type of mutation that occurs spontaneously. we report here a newly identified hprt mutation in a japanese patient with OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926. this gene, designated hprt tokyo, had a single nucleotide change from g to a, as identified by sequencing cdna amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization analysis using amplified genomic dna showed that the mutant gene was transmitted from the maternal germ line. this mutation would lead to an amino acid substitution of asp for gly at the amino acid position 140 located within the putative 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (prpp) binding region. missense mutations in human hprt deficient patients thus far reported tend to accumulate in this functionally active region. however, a comparison of the data suggested that both missense and synonymous mutations can occur at any coding sequence of the human germ line hprt gene, but that a limited percentage of all the missense mutations cause DOID4MESHD004194. the probability that a mutation will cause DOID4MESHD004194 tends to be higher when the missense mutation is within a functionally important sequence.. 
1301201	in vitro and in vivo correlations for i65t and m1v mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus. mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600) locus are the major cause of hyperphenylalaninemia. we have previously described four mutations (m1v, ivs12nt1, r408w, and s349p) at the OMIM178600 locus in french canadians with ancestry in eastern quebec. here we report (1) identification of another mutation, on a haplotype 9 chromosome, which converts codon 65 from isoleucine (att) to threonine (act), (2) expression analysis of the i65t mutation in cos cells demonstrating 75% loss of both immunoreactive protein and enzyme activity, and (3) expression analysis of the most prevalent OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 allele (m1v) in eastern quebec, showing nondetectable levels of OMIM178600 protein and activity, a finding compatible with a mutation in the translation initiation codon. homozygosity for m1v and codominant inheritance of i65t/r408w were both associated with classical OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661.. 
10557317	experimental OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 due to mhc class i OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 deficiency: immune status and iron metabolism. the puzzling linkage between DOID2352OMIM235200MESHD006432 and histocompatibility loci became even more so when the gene involved, OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432, was identified. indeed, within the well defined, mainly peptide-binding, mhc class i family of molecules, OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 seems to perform an unusual yet essential function. as yet, our understanding of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 function in iron homeostasis is only partial; an even more open question is its possible role in the immune system. to advance on both of these avenues, we report the deletion of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 alpha1 and alpha2 putative ligand binding domains in vivo. OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432-deficient animals were analyzed for a comprehensive set of metabolic and immune parameters. faithfully mimicking human OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432, mice homozygous for this deletion develop MESHD019190, characterized by a higher plasma iron content and a raised transferrin saturation as well as an elevated hepatic iron load. the primary OMIM188560 could, indeed, be traced to an augmented duodenal iron absorption. in parallel, measurement of the gut mucosal iron content as well as iron regulatory proteins allows a more informed evaluation of various hypotheses regarding the precise role of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 in iron homeostasis. finally, an extensive phenotyping of primary and secondary lymphoid organs including the gut provides no compelling evidence for an obvious immune-linked function for OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432.. 
144081	[genetic heterogeneity of DOID2862MESHD005955: mutant alleles of g6pd in the shekii district of azerbaijan] examination on DOID2862MESHD005955 in 349 patients of shekii district hospital (azerbaijan) revealed 16 hemi-, 4 homo- and 9 heterozygotic carriers of the OMIM188560. gd- frequency, calculated from the data obtained (7. 7%), may be compared to neighbouring regions frequencies (6-30%). carriers of DOID2862MESHD005955 are residents of 11 villages located in alasani-aphtalan valley, highly endemic with DOID12365OMIM609148OMIM611162MESHD008288 in the past; nearly all marriages are endogamic. physico-chemical and kinetic study of 10 mutant forms of g6pd, according to who program, led to identification of 5 variants of the ii class (shekii, bideiz, shirin-bulakh, okhut i and zakataly) and 2 variants of the iii class (okhut ii and martinique-like). resemblance of the majority of variants in electrophoretic mobility and the level of erythrocyte enzyme activity permit to suggest the existence of a common parental mutant g6pd allele distributed in this area. 
6453040	[gd- allele distribution patterns in azerbaijan. iii. the identification of mutant forms of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase] in 28 families with DOID2862MESHD005955 living in 3 settlements of shekii district of azerbaijan 11 g6pd variants of ii and iii classes differing by kinetic properties were identified according who program. 9 of them are characterized with the same electrophoretic mobility. comparison of g6pd spectra in two subpopulations and in a mixed group permits to make a conclusion about existence of common and rare g6pd alleles in examined population. they distribute by gene drift supported by natural selection. among 7 samples of g6pd with normal and increased activity two new variants of iv class -- nukha and bash-kungut -- were found.. 
10878391	determination of carrier status for the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 by flow cytometric analysis of OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 protein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 (was) is caused by defects in the was protein (wasp) gene on the x chromosome. previous study disclosed that flow cytometric analysis of intracellular wasp expression (OMIM614937-wasp analysis) in lymphocytes was useful for the diagnosis of was patients. lymphocytes from all was patients showed waspdim instead of waspbright. here we report that OMIM614937-wasp analysis in monocytes could be a useful tool for the was carrier diagnosis. monocytes from all nine was carriers showed varied population of waspdim together with waspbright. none of control individuals possessed the waspdim population. in contrast, lymphocytes from all the carriers except two lacked the waspdim population. the difference of the waspdim population in monocytes and lymphocytes observed in was carriers suggests that wasp plays a more critical role in the development of lymphocytes than in that of monocytes. the present studies suggest that a skewed x-chromosomal inactivation pattern observed in was carrier peripheral blood cells is not fixed at the hemopoietic stem cell level but progresses after the lineage commitment.. 
2161209	linkage of dna markers at xq28 to OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 and OMIM300100MESHD000326 present within the same family. we present a large kindred that contained patients with either OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326) or OMIM300100MESHD000326 (amn). the pedigree clearly supported the x-linked mode of inheritance of the nonneonatal form of OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326/amn. analysis with dna markers at xq28 suggested segregation of both OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 and amn with an identical haplotype. this indicated that nonneonatal OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 and amn are caused by a mutation in the same gene at xq28. it showed, furthermore, that phenotypic differences between OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 and amn are not necessarily the consequence of allelic heterogeneity due to different mutations within the same gene. the maximal lod score for linkage of the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326/amn gene and the multiallelic anonymous dna marker at dxs52 was 3. 0 at a recombination fraction of 0. 00. this made a prenatal or presymptomatic diagnosis and heterozygote detection by dna analysis with this marker reliable. 
8326491	further investigation of the hexa gene intron 9 donor splice site mutation frequently found in non-jewish OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 patients from the british isles. in a previous study we found that a OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 (OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661) causing mutation in the intron 9 donor splice site of the hexa gene occurs at high frequency in non-jewish patients and carriers from the british isles. it was found more frequently in subjects of irish, scottish, and welsh origin compared with english origin (63% and 31% respectively). we have now tested, in a blind study, 26 american OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 carriers and 28 non-carriers who have british ancestry for the intron 9 splice site mutation. six of the carriers and none of the controls were positive for the mutation. all six had irish ancestry, compared with nine of the 20 other (intron 9 mutation negative) OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 carriers (p < 0. 05). these results confirm the previously found high frequency of the intron 9 mutation in non-jewish OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 families of british isles, particularly irish, origin, and reinforce the need to screen such families for this mutation. 
7959767	the murine homologues of the OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 gene (hdh) and the alpha-adducin gene (add1) map to mouse chromosome 5 within a region of conserved synteny with human chromosome 4p16.3. OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 (hd) is a severe OMIM178110MESHC566739 DOID1289MESHD019636 associated with a novel gene (it15). recently, we reported the cloning of hdh, the murine homologue of it15. here, using an interspecific backcross, we have mapped both hdh and the mouse homologue of human alpha-adducin (add1), a membrane-associated cytoskeletal protein gene. both of these genes map in the same position on mouse chromosome 5 in a region associated with ancestral chromosomal rearrangements and show no recombination with d5h4s43, d5h4s115, and d5h4s62, the murine homologues of d4s43, d4s115, and d4s62, respectively. further mapping studies of humans, mice, and other mammalian species should reveal the nature of the rearrangements affecting this chromosomal segment during mammalian evolution.. 
2562820	linkage analysis of the apolipoprotein c2 gene and OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 on human chromosome 19 reveals linkage disequilibrium in a french-canadian population. the gene for human apolipoprotein c2 (apoc2), situated on the proximal long arm of chromosome 19, is closely linked to the gene for the most common form of adult muscular OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 dystrophy (dm). six apoc2 rflps (taqi, bgli, bani, bamhi, ncoi, and avaii) have been identified to date. we have conducted a comprehensive dm linkage study utilizing all six rflps and involving 50 families and 372 individuals. the most informative rflps are, in descending order, ncoi (lod = 6. 64, theta = 0. 05), bgli (lod = 6. 12, theta = 0. 05), avaii (lod = 6. 02, theta = 0. 03), bani (lod = 5. 76, theta = 0. 04), taqi (lod = 4. 29, theta = 0. 06), and bamhi (lod = 1. 75, theta = 0. 01). a substantial increase in the lod scores over those seen with the individual rflps was obtained when the linkage of the entire apoc2 haplotype (composed of the six rflps) was studied (lod = 17. 87, theta = 0. 04). we have observed significant inter-apoc2 rflp linkage disequilibrium. consequently, the three most informative rflps have been found to be bani, taqi, and either bgli, avaii, or ncoi polymorphisms. we also demonstrate linkage disequilibrium between dm and apoc2 in our french-canadian population (standardized disequilibrium constant phi =. 22, chi 2 = 5. 12, df = 1, p less than 0. 04). this represents the first evidence of linkage disequilibrium between apoc2 and the dm locus. 
10094552	a retrospective anonymous pilot study in screening newborns for OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 mutations in scandinavian populations. we have retrospectively analyzed 837 random anonymized dried blood spot (dbs) samples from neonatal screening programs in scandinavia for mutations in OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432, the candidate gene for OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432. we have found c282y allele frequencies of 2. 3% (+ 2. 0%) (-1. 3%) in greenland, 4. 5% +/-1. 9% in iceland, 5. 1% +/-2. 3% in the faeroe islands, and 8. 2% +/-2. 7% in denmark. the high prevalence of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 mutations in denmark suggests that population screening for the c282y mutation could be highly advantageous in terms of preventive health care. long-term follow-up evaluation of c282y homozygotes and h63d/c282y compound heterozygotes will give an indication of the penetrance of the mutations.
10484981	hereditary tp53 codon 292 and somatic p16ink4a codon 94 mutations in a OMIM151623DOID3012MESHD016864 family. OMIM151623DOID3012MESHD016864 is an OMIM178110MESHC566739 disorder that is characterized by various types of DOID162MESHD009369 in childhood and adult cases. although hereditary tp53 mutation is very rare in different human DOID162MESHD009369, it has been frequently reported in OMIM151623DOID3012MESHD016864. on the other hand, hereditary mutations of tp57kip2, p15ink4b, and p16ink4a, which affect the cell cycle similar to tp53, were observed in some types of DOID162MESHD009369. in a turkish family with the diagnosis of OMIM151623DOID3012MESHD016864, we analyzed the mutation pattern of tp53, p57kip2, p15ink4b, and p16ink4a in the peripheral blood, and loss of heterozygosity (homo/hemizygous deletion) pattern of tp53 and p15ink4b/p16ink4a in two DOID162MESHD009369 tissues. the propositus had a DOID4440DOID5842MESHD018239, his daughter a OMIM155255DOID0050902DOID3861DOID3864DOID3868DOID3869MESHD008527, and one of his healthy cousins, a tp53 codon 292 missense point mutation (OMIM100070MESHC565230-- > ata; lys-- > ile) in the peripheral blood cells. DOID162MESHD009369 tissue obtained from the propositus with the DOID4440DOID5842MESHD018239 revealed loss of heterozygosity in the tp53 gene. in the analyses of DOID162MESHD009369 tissues from the propositus and his daughter, a p16ink4a codon 94 missense point mutation (gcg-- > gag; ala-- > glu) was observed with the hereditary tp53 mutation. p16ink4a codon 94 mutation observed in our family is a novel mutation in OMIM151623DOID3012MESHD016864. no other gene alteration in tp53, p57kip2, p15ink4b, and p16ink4a was observed. existence of the p16ink4a mutation and the hereditary tp53 mutation with or without loss of heterozygosity in the tp53 gene (DOID4440DOID5842MESHD018239/OMIM155255DOID0050902DOID3861DOID3864DOID3868DOID3869MESHD008527) may be evidence for a common mechanism involved in tumorogenesis. the gene alterations in tp53 and p16ink4a genes may be used as DOID162MESHD009369 markers in our family.. 
2884570	an amino-acid substitution involved in OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 is in linkage disequilibrium with dna haplotype 2. OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 (OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661) is an autosomal recessive human DOID630MESHD030342 caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600, phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, ec 1. 14. 16. 1). OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 is a common inborn error of amino-acid metabolism in caucasian populations and approximately 1 in 50 individuals are carriers of a OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 allele. to define the molecular basis of OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661, we characterized twelve restriction fragment-length polymorphism (rflp) haplotypes of the OMIM178600 locus in the northern european population and observed that 90% of the OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 alleles in this population are confined to four common rflp haplotypes. we have recently reported a splicing mutation in the OMIM178600 gene that is associated with rflp haplotype 3 which is present at about 40% of mutant alleles. we now report the molecular lesion associated with the rflp haplotype 2 mutant allele. this OMIM188560 is caused by a c-to-t transition in exon 12 resulting in an amino-acid substitution (arg to trp) at residue 408 of OMIM178600. direct hybridization analysis of the point mutation using a specific oligonucleotide probe demonstrated that this mutation is also in linkage disequilibrium with rflp haplotype 2 alleles that make up about 20% of mutant OMIM178600 genes 
8258524	the effects of dystrophin gene mutations on the erg in mice and humans. purpose. the authors earlier findings of a negative electroretinogram (erg) in a boy with duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) led them to investigate dystrophin gene deletions and ergs in five boys with OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388. the authors wanted to determined whether there were similar erg findings in an animal model for OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388, the OMIM309200MESHC564108 mouse. methods. ganzfeld ergs were recorded in five boys with OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 after a complete ophthalmic examination. the dystrophin gene was analyzed by southern blot hybridization. ergs were recorded in anesthetized OMIM309200MESHC564108 and control mice with a modified grass photostimulator (grass instrument company, quincy, ma). results. ophthalmic examinations in all five boys had normal findings, yet an abnormal negative erg was recorded for each subject. the subjects gene deletions were variable, ranging from large deletions to no detectable deletions. the ergs of the OMIM309200MESHC564108 mice were normal and did not differ significantly from those of the control mice. conclusions. the authors believe the unique erg recorded for the human subjects is a manifestation of OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 associated with defects at the dystrophin gene locus and represents a new clinical entity. the erg of the OMIM309200MESHC564108 mouse may be spared for several reasons, including milder effects of the mouse gene OMIM188560, differences in muscle and retinal gene product, or species differences in the biochemical role of dystrophin. the erg shows promise of becoming a noninvasive diagnostic tool for OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 and its milder allelic forms.. 
1324223	eight novel inactivating germ line mutations at the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM105210) is a dominantly inherited condition predisposing to OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179. the recent isolation of the responsible gene (DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 or OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125) has facilitated the search for germ line mutations in affected individuals. previous authors have used the rnase protection assay and the single-strand conformation polymorphisms procedure to screen for mutations. in this study we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). dgge analysis of 10 OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 exons (4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and part of 15) in 33 unrelated dutch OMIM105210 patients has led to the identification of eight novel germ line mutations resulting in stop codons or frameshifts. the results reported here indicate that (1) DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 is caused by an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of point mutations; (2) all the mutations found in this study are chain terminating; and (3) dgge represents a rapid and sensitive technique for the detection of mutations in the unusually large OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene. an extension of the dgge analysis to the entire coding region in a sufficient number of clinically well-characterized, unrelated patients will facilitate the establishment of genotype-phenotype correlations. on the other hand, the occurrence of an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of mutations spread throughout the entire length of the large OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene among the OMIM105210 patients indicates that this approach may not be useful as a rapid presymptomatic diagnostic procedure in a routine laboratory. nevertheless, the above dgge approach has incidentally led to the identification of a common polymorphism in exon 13. such intragenic polymorphisms offer a practical approach to a more rapid procedure for presymptomatic diagnosis of OMIM105210 by linkage analysis in informative families.. 
10533068	novel mutations in OMIM312700DOID8465MESHD041441 causing DOID8465OMIM312700MESHD041441, including first evidence of putative leader sequence change. juvenile DOID8465OMIM312700MESHD041441 is an DOID0080012 caused by mutations in the OMIM312700DOID8465MESHD041441 gene. we screened 31 new unrelated patients and families for OMIM312700DOID8465MESHD041441 mutations in addition to previously reported mutations for 60 of our families (DOID8465OMIM312700MESHD041441 consortium, hum mol genet 1998; 7  1185-1192). twenty-three different mutations including 12 novel ones were identified in 28 patients. mutations identified in this study include 19 missense mutations, two nonsense mutations, one intragenic deletion, four microdeletions, one insertion, and one intronic sequence substitution that is likely to result in a splice site OMIM188560. two novel mutations, c. 38t-- > c (l13p) and c. 667t-- > c (c223r), respectively, present the first genetic evidence for the functional significance of the putative leader peptide sequence and for the functional significance at the carboxyl terminal of the OMIM312700DOID8465MESHD041441 protein beyond the discoidin domain. mutations in 25 of the families were localized to exons 4-6, emphasizing the critical functional significance of the discoidin domain of the OMIM312700DOID8465MESHD041441 protein 
6585184	clinical use of dna markers linked to the gene for duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136. seventy families with duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) known to the institute of child health fall into three categories with respect to potential linkage analysis with the x chromosome dna markers rc8 and l1. 28 that bridge the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene. families in which there is at least one obligatory female heterozygote (n = 13). here prediction and exclusion of OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene transmission may be possible, the accuracy being dependent on the closeness of the linkage of the dna marker (s) to the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene; an illustrative case is reported. families in which there is a single affected boy, who also has one or more healthy brothers (n = 26). given an informative restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp), the probability that the boy represents a new mutation can be reassessed; it is also possible to exclude the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene in a sister. families with a single affected boy with no brother (n = 30). here exclusion of the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene in a sister may be possible. only in one family was there no possibility of useful linkage analysis. the linkage analysis required is described, and the need to check OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 families for informative rflps is stressed. 
8471773	molecular characterization of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency in patients of chinese descent and identification of new base substitutions in the human g6pd gene. the underlying dna changes associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) -deficient asians have not been extensively investigated. to fill this gap, we sequenced the g6pd gene of 43 g6pd-deficient chinese whose g6pd was well characterized biochemically. dna samples were obtained from peripheral blood of these individuals for sequencing using a direct polymerase chain reaction (pcr) sequencing procedure. from these 43 samples, we have identified five different types of nucleotide substitutions in the g6pd gene  at cdna 1388 from g to a (arg to his); at cdna 1376 from g to t (arg to leu); at cdna 1024 from c to t (leu to phe); at cdna 392 from g to t (gly to val); at cdna 95 from a to g (his to arg). these five nucleotide substitutions account for over 83% of our 43 g6pd-deficient samples and these substitutions have not been reported in non-asians. the substitutions found at cdna 392 and cdna 1024 are new findings. the substitutions at cdna 1376 and 1388 account for over 50% of the 43 samples examined indicating a high prevalence of these two alleles among g6pd-deficient chinese. our findings add support to the notion that diverse point mutations may account largely for much of the phenotypic heterogeneity of DOID2862MESHD005955.. 
8314592	OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 gene: characterization of deletions and possible function. positional cloning experiments have resulted recently in the isolation of a candidate gene for OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 (DOID0060844OMIM310600MESHC537849; ndp), a severe x-linked MESHD065886. here we report the isolation and analysis of human genomic dna clones encompassing the ndp gene. the gene spans 28 kb and consists of 3 exons, the first of which is entirely contained within the 5 untranslated region. detailed analysis of genomic deletions in norrie patients shows that they are heterogeneous, both in size and in position. by pcr analysis, we found that expression of the ndp gene was not confined to the eye or to the brain. an extensive dna and protein sequence comparison between the human ndp gene and related genes from the database revealed homology with cysteine-rich protein-binding domains of immediate--early genes implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation. we propose that ndp is a molecule related in function to these genes and may be involved in a pathway that regulates neural cell differentiation and proliferation.. 
122435	prenatal diagnosis of DOID14497MESHD015223. two pregnancies at risk for DOID14497MESHD015223 were monitored by assay and electrophoresis of acid lipase in cultured amniotic-fluid cells. cells from patient 1 had 5% of control levels of acid lipase, using 14c-triolein as substrate; however, when artificial substrates (esters of 4-methylumbelliferone and p-nitrophenol) were used to measure acid lipase, these cells had 30% of control levels. electrophoresis of cell extracts revealed the absence of the a form of acid lipase, consistent with the diagnosis of DOID14497MESHD015223. analysis of fetal tissues following prostaglandin termination of this pregnancy confirmed the diagnosis. assay of fetal-skin fibroblasts with 14c-triolein, as well as with artificial substrates, showed marked deficiency of acid lipase activity. electrophoresis of fetal-tissue extracts also demonstrated the absence of the a form of acid lipase. amniotic-fluid cells from patient 2 showed normal levels of acid lipase with all substrates tested; the electrophoretic pattern of acid lipase was normal. the results suggest that the prenatal diagnosis of DOID14497MESHD015223 be made using the radioassay of acid lipase and/or electrophoresis.. 
7795652	somatic mutations in the brca1 gene in sporadic ovarian tumours. the brca1 gene on chromosome 17q21 is responsible for an OMIM178110MESHC566739 DOID225MESHD013577 of increased susceptibility to breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 but no somatic mutations in tumours have yet been described. to study the potential role of brca1 in sporadic MESHD063646, we analysed the genomic dna of tumour and normal fractions of 47 DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051 for mutations in brca1 using the single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. we now describe somatic mutations in the dna of four tumours which also had loss of heterozygosity (loh) at a brca1 intragenic marker. our data support a tumour suppressor mechanism for brca1; somatic mutations and loh may result in inactivation of brca1 in at least a small number of DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051.. 
2180286	skewed x inactivation in a female mz twin results in duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136. one of female mz twins presented with DOID9884MESHD009136. physical examination, creatine phosphokinase levels, and muscle biopsy were consistent with duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388). however, because of her sex she was diagnosed as having DOID11724MESHD049288. with cdna probes to the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene, a gene deletion was detected in the twins and their mother. the de novo mutation which arose in the mother was shown by novel junction fragments generated by hindiii, psti, or taqi when probed with cdna8. additional evidence of a large gene deletion was given by novel sfii junction fragments detected by probes p20, j-bir, and j-66 on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). immunoblot analysis of muscle from the affected twin showed dystrophin of normal size but of reduced amount. immunofluorescent visualization of dystrophin revealed foci of dystrophin-positive fibers adjacent to foci of dystrophin-negative fibers. these data indicate that the affected twin is a manifesting carrier of an abnormal OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene, her DOID423MESHD009135 being a direct result of underexpression of dystrophin. cytogenetic analysis revealed normal karyotypes, eliminating the possibility of a translocation affecting OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene function. both linkage analysis and dna fingerprint analysis revealed that each twin has two different x chromosomes, eliminating the possibility of MESHD024182 as a mechanism for OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 expression. on the basis of methylation differences of the paternal and maternal x chromosomes in these mz twins, we propose uneven lyonization (x chromosome inactivation) as the underlying mechanism for DOID4MESHD004194 expression in the affected female.. 
1316718	coincident kaposi DOID1115DOID4235DOID6193MESHD012509 and MESHD016399 in a patient with the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923. a 24 year old male with a history of DOID2723MESHD004485, recurrent mild MESHD007239, and DOID1588MESHD013921 consistent with the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 (was) presented with a mediastinal mass, generalized MESHD000072281, MESHD013163, and severe DOID1588MESHD013921. studies of immune function including immunoglobulin levels and t-cell subsets were normal. furthermore, his t lymphocytes proliferated normally in response to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin a, and the combination of neuraminidase/galactose oxidase. however, their proliferative responses to anti-cd43 antibody and periodate were diminished, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of was. an initial inguinal lymph node biopsy surprisingly revealed kaposi DOID1115DOID4235DOID6193MESHD012509. however, following splenectomy to increase the platelet count, biopsy of the mediastinal mass revealed t-cell large cell DOID0060058MESHD008223. studies of biopsied tissue for the presence of epstein-barr virus and cytomegalovirus were negative, as were studies of blood, including the polymerase chain reaction, for the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). this is the first report of kaposi DOID1115DOID4235DOID6193MESHD012509 arising in a patient with a MESHD000081207. although kaposi DOID1115DOID4235DOID6193MESHD012509 can arise in the OMIM600901DOID0111084 of the severe immunosuppression that follows allograft transplantation and in patients infected with hiv, we postulate that longevity in the OMIM600901DOID0111084 of mild immunosuppression was the major factor in the development of kaposi DOID1115DOID4235DOID6193MESHD012509 in this patient.. 
7964884	treatment of OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294: effects of chenodeoxycholic acid, pravastatin, and combined use. treatments by oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid (cdca) alone, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (hmg) coa reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) alone, and combination of the two drugs were attempted for 7 patients with OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294 (OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294). cdca treatment at a dose of 300 mg/day reduced serum cholestanol (67. 3% reduction), lathosterol (50. 8%), campesterol (61. 7%) and sitosterol (12. 7%). however, the sera of the patients changed to be " atherogenic "; total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (ldl) -cholesterol were increased, while high-density lipoprotein (hdl) -cholesterol was decreased. contrarily, pravastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day improved the sera of the patients to be markedly " anti-atherogenic ", but the reductions of cholestanol (30. 4%), lathosterol (44. 0%), campesterol (22. 9%) and sitosterol (9. 6%) were inadequate. combined treatment with cdca and pravastatin showed good overlapping of the effects of each drug alone. the sera of the patients were apparently more " anti-atherogenic " than those after cdca treatment. serum cholestanol concentration was still 2. 7 times higher than in controls, but the serum lathosterol level was within the normal range, indicating that the enhancement of overall cholesterol synthesis in the patients was sufficiently suppressed. plant sterol levels were also within the normal range. the combination of cdca and pravastatin was a good treatment for OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294, based on the improvement of serum lipoprotein metabolism, the suppression of cholesterol synthesis, and reductions of cholestanol and plant sterol levels. in all of 7 patients, the progression of DOID4MESHD004194 was arrested, but dramatic effects on clinical manifestations, DOID3345MESHD014973, and electrophysiological findings could not be found after the treatment of these drugs 
102474	combined genetic deficiency of c6 and c7 in man. by routine screening of sera, a subject was discovered who showed a sub-total deficiency of c6 and c7. no clinical DOID4MESHD004194 was associated with this deficiency which was transmitted through the subjects family as a single genetic characteristic, the OMIM612446MESHC567307 being associated with a silent allele at the structural locus. the propositus was found to have low quantities of an abnormal c6 which was both antigenically deficient and smaller in size than normal c6 (110, 000 daltons compared with 140, 000 daltons) and small quantities of apparently normal c7. it is concluded that the most likely explanation for this OMIM188560 is that the subject has a structural mutation in his c6 gene which produces hyopsynthesis not only of c6 but also of the closely linked gene for c7. these findings suggest the possibility that c6 and c7 may function as a single genetic unit and that the primary transcript copied from the genome includes information for both proteins.. 
2651669	partial MESHC537828 without langer-DOID14743OMIM190350MESHC536820: a recognisable DOID225MESHD013577. we report two de novo cases of del (8) (pter----q24. 1 ) with breakpoints involving the distal part of band 8q24. 1 1. the clinical features were similar and there were no obvious stigmata of langer-DOID14743OMIM190350MESHC536820 (OMIM150230DOID4998MESHD015826). there are three other cases reported with a deletion of chromosome 8 at approximately the same breakpoint, one without OMIM150230DOID4998MESHD015826 and some similarities to our cases, the other two with OMIM150230DOID4998MESHD015826. our findings would support the observation that the critical segment for the assignment of OMIM150230DOID4998MESHD015826 is proximal to or involves the proximal part of 8q24. 1, but a review of published reports suggests that the aetiology of OMIM150230DOID4998MESHD015826 may be a more complex issue 
10930361	iron-dependent self-assembly of recombinant yeast frataxin: implications for OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561. frataxin deficiency is the primary cause of OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561 (OMIM229300MESHC565561), an autosomal recessive cardiodegenerative and DOID1289MESHD019636. frataxin is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein that is widely conserved among eukaryotes. genetic inactivation of the yeast frataxin homologue (yfh1p) results in mitochondrial iron accumulation and DOID1205MESHD006967 to oxidative stress. increased iron deposition and evidence of oxidative damage have also been observed in cardiac tissue and cultured fibroblasts from patients with OMIM229300MESHC565561. these findings indicate that frataxin is essential for mitochondrial iron homeostasis and protection from iron-induced formation of free radicals. the functional mechanism of frataxin, however, is still unknown. we have expressed the mature form of yfh1p (myfh1p) in escherichia coli and have analyzed its function in vitro. isolated myfh1p is a soluble monomer (13, 783 da) that contains no iron and shows no significant tendency to self-associate. aerobic addition of ferrous iron to myfh1p results in assembly of regular spherical multimers with a molecular mass of approximately 1. 1 mda (megadaltons) and a diameter of 13 +/-2 nm. each multimer consists of approximately 60 subunits and can sequester > 3, 000 atoms of iron. titration of myfh1p with increasing iron concentrations supports a stepwise mechanism of multimer assembly. sequential addition of an iron chelator and a reducing agent results in quantitative iron release with concomitant disassembly of the multimer, indicating that myfh1p sequesters iron in an available form. in yeast mitochondria, native myfh1p exists as monomer and a higher-order species with a molecular weight > 600, 000. after addition of (55) fe to the medium, immunoprecipitates of this species contain > 16 atoms of (55) fe per molecule of myfh1p. we propose that iron-dependent self-assembly of recombinant myfh1p reflects a physiological role for frataxin in mitochondrial iron sequestration and bioavailability.. 
10698963	human mutations in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase reflect evolutionary history. glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) is a cytosolic enzyme encoded by a housekeeping x-linked gene whose main function is to produce nadph, a key electron donor in the defense against oxidizing agents and in reductive biosynthetic reactions. inherited DOID2862MESHD005955 is associated with either episodic hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740 (triggered by fava beans or other agents) or life-long hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740. we show here that an evolutionary analysis is a key to understanding the biology of a housekeeping gene. from the alignment of the amino acid (aa) sequence of 52 glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) species from 42 different organisms, we found a striking correlation between the aa replacements that cause DOID2862MESHD005955 in humans and the sequence conservation of g6pd  two-thirds of such replacements are in highly and moderately conserved (50-99%) aa; relatively few are in fully conserved aa (where they might be lethal) or in poorly conserved aa, where presumably they simply would not cause DOID2862MESHD005955. this is consistent with the notion that all human mutants have residual enzyme activity and that null mutations are lethal at some stage of development. comparing the distribution of mutations in a human housekeeping gene with evolutionary conservation is a useful tool for pinpointing amino acid residues important for the stability or the function of the corresponding protein. in view of the current explosive increase in full genome sequencing projects, this tool will become rapidly available for numerous other genes.. 
8162051	regionally clustered OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutations are associated with a severe phenotype and occur at a high frequency in new mutation cases of DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125. germline mutation in OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 at 5q21-22 results in the dominantly inherited DOID225MESHD013577 DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125). somatic mutation in this gene is an early event in colorectal tumourigenesis. both types of mutation are concentrated in the 5 half of exon 15. we have used single strand conformational polymorphism (sscp) and heteroduplex analysis to screen for variants in this region of the gene in a total of 45 affected but unrelated individuals. eighteen patients had no family history of the DOID4MESHD004194; of these 11 were classified as having a severe phenotype, based on an early age at presentation or DOID162MESHD009369 development. this compared with 6 of 27 familial cases. a 5 bp deletion at codon 1309 reported to occur in 10-15% of unselected OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 patients worldwide, was found in 5 of the 18 new mutation cases and 4 of the 27 familial cases  all nine were classed as severe. a further 3 new mutations and 1 familial mutation were located downstream from codon 1309, these individuals similarly being classed as phenotypically severe. in contrast all of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutations detected in affected individuals with an average phenotype were located prior to codon 1309. the frequent association of a severe phenotype with fresh mutation may explain the apparent conflict of a high mutation rate (20-30%) in a condition, which on average, is lethal at a post-reproductive age.. 
10205262	analysis of OMIM203500DOID9270MESHD000474 (OMIM203500MESHD000474) mutations and polymorphisms reveals that the ccc sequence motif is a mutational hot spot in the homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase gene (hgo). we recently showed that OMIM203500DOID9270MESHD000474 (OMIM203500MESHD000474) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the homogentisate 1, 2 dioxygenase gene (hgo). herein we describe haplotype and mutational analyses of hgo in seven new OMIM203500MESHD000474 pedigrees. these analyses identified two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (inv4 + 31a-- > g and inv11 + 18a-- > g) and six novel OMIM203500MESHD000474 mutations (inv1-1g-- > a, w60g, y62c, a122d, p230t, and d291e), which further illustrates the remarkable allelic heterogeneity found in OMIM203500MESHD000474. reexamination of all 29 mutations and polymorphisms thus far described in hgo shows that these nucleotide changes are not randomly distributed; the ccc sequence motif and its inverted complement, ggg, are preferentially mutated. these analyses also demonstrated that the nucleotide substitutions in hgo do not involve cpg dinucleotides, which illustrates important differences between hgo and other genes for the occurrence of mutation at specific short-sequence motifs. because the ccc sequence motifs comprise a significant proportion (34. 5%) of all mutated bases that have been observed in hgo, we conclude that the ccc triplet is a mutational hot spot in hgo. 
7450778	further evidence for heterogeneity of DOID2862MESHD005955 in papua new guinea. four new g6pd variants have been characterized in individuals from papua new guinea. this study demonstrates that the previously reported markham variant and the newly characterized salata variant may be widely distributed in papua new guinea. th data presented here together with those of previously published studies demonstrate a degree of heterogeneity of DOID2862MESHD005955 that is much higher than that in other regions of the world where DOID2862MESHD005955 is common.. 
10353787	overgrowth of oral mucosa and facial skin, a novel feature of OMIM208400DOID0050461MESHD054880. OMIM208400DOID0050461MESHD054880 (OMIM208400MESHD054880) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of aspartylglucosaminidase (OMIM109200). the main symptom is progressive DOID1059MESHD008607. a spectrum of different mutations has been reported in this DOID4MESHD004194, one missense mutation (cys163ser) being responsible for the majority of finnish cases. we were able to examine 66 finnish OMIM208400MESHD054880 patients for changes in the oral mucosa and 44 of these for changes in facial skin. biopsy specimens of 16 oral lesions, 12 of them associated with the teeth, plus two facial lesions were studied histologically. immunohistochemical staining for OMIM109200 was performed on 15 oral specimens. skin was seborrhoeic in adolescent and adult patients, with MESHD004890 of the facial skin already common in childhood. of 44 patients, nine (20%) had facial MESHD018322, tumours primarily occurring in association with DOID13515MESHD014402. oedemic buccal mucosa (leucoedema) and DOID3086MESHD019214 were more frequent in OMIM208400MESHD054880 patients than in controls (p < 0. 001). of 16 oral mucosal lesions studied histologically, 15 represented fibroepithelial or epithelial MESHD006965 and were reactive in nature. cytoplasmic vacuolisation was evident in four. immunohistochemically, expression of OMIM109200 in OMIM208400MESHD054880 patients mucosal lesions did not differ from that seen in corresponding lesions of normal subjects. thus, the high frequency of mucosal overgrowth in OMIM208400MESHD054880 patients does not appear to be directly associated with lysosomal storage or with alterations in the level of OMIM109200 expression.

1345170	linkage disequilibrium mapping in isolated founder populations: OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170 in finland. linkage disequilibrium mapping in isolated populations provides a powerful tool for fine structure localization of DOID4MESHD004194 genes. here, luria and delbrucks classical methods for analysing bacterial cultures are adapted to the study of human isolated founder populations in order to estimate (i) the recombination fraction between a DOID4MESHD004194 locus and a marker; (ii) the expected degree of allelic homogeneity in a population; and (iii) the mutation rate of marker loci. using these methods, we report striking linkage disequilibrium for OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170 (OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170) in finland indicating that the OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170 gene should lie within 0. 06 centimorgans (or about 60 kilobases) of the csf1r gene. predictions about allelic homogeneity in finland and mutation rates in simple sequence repeats are confirmed by independent observations. 
10615125	mutations in tnfrsf11a, affecting the signal peptide of rank, cause familial expansile MESHD010014. familial expansile MESHD010014 (OMIM174810DOID0111542MESHC536335, mim 174810) is a rare, OMIM178110MESHC566739 bone disorder characterized by focal areas of increased bone remodelling. the osteolytic lesions, which develop usually in the long bones during early adulthood, show increased osteoblast and osteoclast activity. our previous linkage studies mapped the gene responsible for OMIM174810DOID0111542MESHC536335 to an interval of less than 5 cm between d18s64 and d18s51 on chromosome 18q21. 2-21 2-21. 3 in a large northern irish family. the gene encoding receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa b (rank; ref. 5), tnfrsf11a, maps to this region. rank is essential in osteoclast formation. we identified two heterozygous insertion mutations in exon 1 of tnfrsf11a in affected members of four families with OMIM174810DOID0111542MESHC536335 or familial DOID5408OMIM167250OMIM602080OMIM616833MESHD010001 (pdb). one was a duplication of 18 bases and the other a duplication of 27 bases, both of which affected the signal peptide region of the rank molecule. expression of recombinant forms of the mutant rank proteins revealed perturbations in expression levels and lack of normal cleavage of the signal peptide. both mutations caused an increase in rank-mediated nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) signalling in vitro, consistent with the presence of an activating mutation.

8317477	the normal OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 (hd) allele, or a closely linked gene, influences age at onset of hd. we evaluated the hypothesis that OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 (hd) is influenced by the normal hd allele by comparing transmission patterns of genetically linked markers at the d4s10 locus in the normal parent against age at onset in the affected offspring. analysis of information from 21 sibships in 14 kindreds showed a significant tendency for sibs who have similar onset ages to share the same d4s10 allele from the normal parent. affected sibs who inherited different d4s10 alleles from the normal parent tended to have more variable ages at onset. these findings suggest that the expression of hd is modulated by the normal hd allele or by a closely linked locus.. 
10545613	synergistic effect of histone hyperacetylation and dna demethylation in the reactivation of the fmr1 gene. most OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600 patients have expansion of a (cgg) (n) sequence with > 200 repeats (full mutation) in the fmr1 gene responsible for this condition. hypermethylation of the expanded repeat and of the fmr1 promoter is almost always present and apparently suppresses transcription, resulting in absence of the fmr1 protein. we recently showed that transcriptional reactivation of fmr1 full mutations can be achieved by inducing dna demethylation with 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-azadc). the level of histone acetylation is another important factor in regulating gene expression; therefore, we treated lymphoblastoid cell lines of non-mosaic full mutation patients with three drugs capable of inducing histone hyperacetylation. we observed a consistent, although modest, reactivation of the fmr1 gene with 4-phenylbutyrate, sodium butyrate and trichostatin a, as shown by rt-pcr. however, we report that combining these drugs with 5-azadc results in a 2- to 5-fold increase in fmr1 mrna levels obtained with 5-azadc alone, thus showing a marked synergistic effect of histone hyperacetylation and dna demethylation in the reactivation of fmr1 full mutations.. 
1358807	genetic heterogeneity in x-linked DOID2187MESHD000567. the amelx gene located at xp22. 1-p22. 3 encodes for the enamel protein amelogenin and has been implicated as the gene responsible for the inherited dental abnormality x-linked DOID2187MESHD000567 (xai). three families with xai have been investigated using polymorphic dna markers flanking the position of amelx. using two-point linkage analysis, linkage was established between xai and several of these markers in two families, with a combined lod score of 6. 05 for dxs16 at theta = 0. 04 04. this supports the involvement of amelx, located close to dxs16, in the xai DOID4MESHD004194 process (OMIM301200DOID0110058MESHC538243) in those families. using multipoint linkage analysis, the combined maximum lod score for these two families was 7. 30 for a location of OMIM301200DOID0110058MESHC538243 at 2 cm distal to dxs16. the support interval around this location extended about 8 cm proximal to dxs92, and the OMIM301200DOID0110058MESHC538243 location could not be precisely defined by multipoint mapping. study of recombination events indicated that OMIM301200DOID0110058MESHC538243 lies in the interval between dxs143 and dxs85. there was significant evidence against linkage to this region in the third family, indicating locus heterogeneity in xai. further analysis with markers on the long arm of the x chromosome showed evidence of linkage to dxs144e and f9 with no recombination with either of these markers. two-point analysis gave a peak lod score at dxs144e with a maximum lod score of 2. 83 at theta = 0, with a peak lod score in multipoint linkage analysis of 2. 84 at theta = 0. the support interval extended 9 cm proximal to dxs144e and 14 cm distal to f9.

8304342	anonymous marker loci within 400 kb of hla-a generate haplotypes in linkage disequilibrium with the OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 gene (OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432) the OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 gene (OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432) maps to 6p21. 3 and is less than 1 cm from the hla class i genes; however, the precise physical location of the gene has remained elusive and controversial. the unambiguous identification of a crossover event within OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 families is very difficult; it is particularly hampered by the variability of the phenotypic expression as well as by the sex- and age-related penetrance of the DOID4MESHD004194. for these practical considerations, traditional linkage analysis could prove of limited value in further refining the extrapolated physical position of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432. we therefore embarked upon a linkage-disequilibrium analysis of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 and normal chromosomes from the brittany population. in the present report, 66 OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 families yielding 151 OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 chromosomes and 182 normal chromosomes were rflp-typed with a battery of probes, including two newly derived polymorphic markers from the 6. 7 and hla-f loci located 150 and 250 kb telomeric to hla-a, respectively. the results suggest a strong peak of existing linkage disequilibrium focused within the i82-to-6. 7 interval (approximately 250 kb). the zone of linkage disequilibrium is flanked by the i97 locus, positioned 30 kb proximal to i82, and the hla-f gene, found 250 kb distal to hla-a, markers of which display no significant association with OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432. these data support the possibility that OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 resides within the 400-kb expanse of dna between i97 and hla-f. alternatively, the very tight association of hla-a3 and allele 1 of the 6. 7 locus, both of which are comprised by the major ancestral or founder OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 haplotype in brittany, supports the possibility that the DOID4MESHD004194 gene may reside immediately telomeric to the 6. 7 locus within the linkage-disequilibrium zone. additionally, OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 haplotypes possessing hla-a11 and the low-frequency hla-f polymorphism (allele 2) are supportive of a separate founder chromosome containing a second, independently arising mutant allele. overall, the establishment of a likely " OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 critical region " centromeric boundary and the identification of a linkage-disequilibrium zone both significantly contribute to a reduction in the amount of dna required to be searched for novel coding sequences constituting the OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 OMIM188560 
7617034	natural selection of hemi- and heterozygotes for DOID2862MESHD005955 in africa by resistance to severe DOID12365OMIM609148OMIM611162MESHD008288. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency, the most common enzymopathy of humans, affects over 400 million people. the geographical correlation of its distribution with the historical endemicity of DOID12365OMIM609148OMIM611162MESHD008288 suggests that this disorder has risen in frequency through natural selection by DOID12365OMIM609148OMIM611162MESHD008288. however, attempts to confirm that DOID2862MESHD005955 is protective in case-control studies of DOID12365OMIM609148OMIM611162MESHD008288 have yielded conflicting results. hence, for this x-linked disorder, it is unclear whether both male hemizygotes and female heterozygotes are protected or, as frequently suggested, only females. furthermore, how much protection may be afforded is unknown. here we report that, in two large case-control studies of over 2, 000 african children, the common african form of DOID2862MESHD005955 (g6pd a-) is associated with a 46-58% reduction in risk of severe DOID12365OMIM609148OMIM611162MESHD008288 for both female heterozygotes and male hemizygotes. a mathematical model incorporating the measured selective advantage against DOID12365OMIM609148OMIM611162MESHD008288 suggests that a counterbalancing selective disadvantage, associated with this enzyme deficiency, has retarded its rise in frequency in DOID12365OMIM609148OMIM611162MESHD008288-endemic regions. although DOID2862MESHD005955 is now regarded as a generally benign disorder, in earlier environmental conditions it could have been significantly disadvantageous..

1301187	molecular basis of OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 and related hyperphenylalaninemias: mutations and polymorphisms in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. mutations in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene producing OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 or hyperphenylalaninemia have now been identified in many patients from various ethnic groups. these mutations all exhibit a high degree of association with specific restriction fragment-length polymorphism haplotypes at the OMIM178600 locus. about 50 of these mutations are single-base substitutions, including six nonsense mutations and eight splicing mutations, with the remainder being missense mutations. one splicing mutation results in a 3 amino acid in-frame insertion. two or 3 large deletions, 2 single codon deletions, and 2 single base deletions have been found. twelve of the missense mutations apparently result from the methylation and subsequent deamination of highly mutagenic cpg dinucleotides. recurrent mutation has been observed at several of these sites, producing associations with different haplotypes in different populations. about half of all missense mutations have been examined by in vitro expression analysis, and a significant correlation has been observed between residual OMIM178600 activity and DOID4MESHD004194 phenotype. since continuing advances in molecular methodologies have dramatically accelerated the rate in which new mutations are being identified and characterized, this register of mutations will be updated periodically.. 
1483696	the intron 7 donor splice site transition: a second OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 mutation in french canada. mutations at the hexosaminidase a (hexa) gene which cause OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 (OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661) have elevated frequency in the ashkenazi jewish and french-canadian populations. we report a novel OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 allele in the french-canadian population associated with the infantile form of the DOID4MESHD004194. the mutation, a g-- > a transition at the + 1 position of intron 7, abolishes the donor splice site. cultured human fibroblasts from a compound heterozygote for this transition (and for a deletion mutation) produce no detectable hexa mrna. the intron 7 + 1 mutation occurs in the base adjacent to the site of the adult-onset OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 mutation (g805a). in both mutations a restriction site for the endonuclease ecorii is abolished. unambiguous diagnosis, therefore, requires allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to distinguish between these two mutant alleles. the intron 7 + 1 mutation has been detected in three unrelated families. obligate heterozygotes for the intron 7 + 1 mutation were born in the saguenay-lac-st-jean region of quebec. the most recent ancestors common to obligate carriers of this mutation were from the charlevoix region of the province of quebec. this mutation thus has a different geographic centre of diffusion and is probably less common than the exon 1 deletion OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 mutation in french canadians. neither mutation has been detected in france, the ancestral homeland of french canada.. 
10465113	recessively inherited DOID12721DOID2256OMIM239100OMIM255800OMIM309350OMIM313400MESHD010009 with normal OMIM475000, club foot, and double layered patella caused by a dtdst mutation. we have observed over 25 different mutations in the OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170 sulphate transporter gene (dtdst) in association with the recessive disorders DOID0080043MESHC579878 1b, DOID0050648 2, and OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170. the c862t (r279w) transition is the most common mutation in non-finnish patients, but in these disorders it is usually combined with other dtdst mutations. we had not seen a case of homozygosity for c862t (r279w) until we analysed dna from a 36 year old male with tall-normal OMIM475000 (180 cm) who asked for genetic counselling for suspected DOID12721DOID2256OMIM239100OMIM255800OMIM309350OMIM313400MESHD010009. he was treated for club foot and MESHD006617 at birth. skeletal changes consistent with DOID12721DOID2256OMIM239100OMIM255800OMIM309350OMIM313400MESHD010009, with the peculiar finding of a double layered patella, were recognised during childhood. OMIM119540DOID674MESHD002972MESHC566991, swelling of the ear pinna, and hitch hiker thumb were absent. he was found to be homozygous, and both healthy parents heterozygous, for the r279w mutation in dtdst, and his fibroblasts showed a sulphate incorporation OMIM188560 typical of dtdst disorders. counselling was given for a recessive disorder, thereby considerably reducing the probability of affected offspring. DOID12721DOID2256OMIM239100OMIM255800OMIM309350OMIM313400MESHD010009 is more frequently caused by dominant mutations in the comp (OMIM132400DOID0070303MESHC535501, mckusick 132400) and col9a2 genes (OMIM600204DOID0070298MESHC535502, mckusick 600204). a few other patients and families with features similar to our proband have been described previously and considered to have autosomal recessive med (OMIM226900DOID0070300MESHC535504, mckusick 226900). this observation confirms the existence of this entity and assigns it to the phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations at the dtdst locus.. 
8098180	OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223: size- and sex-dependent dynamics of ctg meiotic instability, and somatic mosaicism. OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder which results from elongations of an unstable (ctg) n repeat, located in the 3 untranslated region of the dm gene. a correlation has been demonstrated between the increase in the repeat number of this sequence and the severity of the DOID4MESHD004194. however, the clinical status of patients cannot be unambiguously ascertained solely on the basis of the number of ctg repeats. moreover, the exclusive maternal inheritance of the congenital form remains unexplained. our observation of differently sized repeats in various dm tissues from the same individual may explain why the size of the mutation observed in lymphocytes does not necessarily correlate with the severity and nature of symptoms. through a molecular and genetic study of 142 families including 418 dm patients, we have investigated the dynamics of the ctg repeat meiotic instability. a positive correlation between the size of the repeat and the intergenerational enlargement was observed similarly through male and female meioses for < or = 0. 5-kb ctg sequences. beyond 0. 5 kb, the intergenerational variation was more important through female meioses, whereas a tendency to compression was observed almost exclusively in male meioses, for > or = 1. 5-kb fragments. this implies a size- and sex-dependent meiotic instability. moreover, segregation analysis supports the hypothesis of a maternal as well as a familial predisposition for the occurrence of the congenital form. finally, this analysis reveals a significant excess of transmitting grandfathers partially accounted for by increased fertility in affected males 
1517503	fatal DOID8553MESHD017511 in association with OMIM610102MESHC566443. although DOID8553MESHD017511 (pg) is often associated with systemic DOID4MESHD004194MESHC, it has not been reported in association with congenital DOID626MESHD000081208. we describe an aggressive and ultimately fatal case of pg in a patient with a congenital OMIM610102MESHC566443. deficiencies of c7 can be associated with decreased neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and opsonization, similar to the immunologic abnormalities described in patients with pg. our patients decreased complement level, if not directly related to the development of pg, may have contributed to the aggressive nature of her DOID4MESHD004194.. 
8589715	emerin deficiency at the nuclear membrane in patients with emery-dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136. mutations in the OMIM475000 gene at the xq28 locus have been found in patients with x-linked emery-dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136 (DOID11726). this gene encodes a hitherto unknown protein named emerin. to elucidate the subcellular localization of emerin, we raised two antisera against synthetic peptide fragments predicted from emerin cdna. using both antisera, we found positive nuclear membrane staining in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles in the normal controls and in patients with DOID440MESHD009468 other than DOID11726. in contrast, a deficiency in immunofluorescent staining of skeletal and cardiac muscle from DOID11726 patients was observed. a 34 kd protein is immunoreactive with the antisera--the protein is equivalent to that predicted for emerin. together, our findings suggest the specific deficiency of emerin in the nuclear membrane of muscle cells in patients with DOID11726.. 
7652577	a p16ink4a-insensitive cdk4 mutant targeted by cytolytic t lymphocytes in a human DOID1909MESHD008545. a mutated cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) was identified as a DOID162MESHD009369-specific antigen recognized by hla-a2. 1-restricted autologous cytolytic t lymphocytes (ctls) in a human DOID1909MESHD008545. the mutated cdk4 allele was present in autologous cultured DOID1909MESHD008545 cells and MESHD009362 tissue, but not in the patients lymphocytes. the mutation, an arginine-to-cysteine exchange at residue 24, was part of the cdk4 peptide recognized by ctls and prevented binding of the cdk4 inhibitor p16ink4a, but not of p21 or of p27kip1. the same mutation was found in one additional DOID1909MESHD008545 among 28 MESHD008545 analyzed. these results suggest that mutation of cdk4 can create a DOID162MESHD009369-specific antigen and can disrupt the cell-cycle regulation exerted by the DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor p16ink4a.. 
10487710	molecular analysis in familial neurohypophyseal DOID9409MESHD003919: early diagnosis of an asymptomatic carrier. familial neurohypophyseal DOID9409MESHD003919 (fndi) is an inherited deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (avp) and is transmitted as an OMIM178110MESHC566739 trait. in the present study we have analyzed the avp-neurophysin ii (avp-npii) gene in a spanish kindred. studies were performed on seven members (four clinically affected) of the family. patients were diagnosed at the hospital universitario gregorio maranon (madrid, spain). the entire coding region of the avp-npii gene of all family members was amplified by pcr and sequenced. all affected individuals presented a missense mutation (g1757-- > a) that replaces glycine at position 23 with arginine within the npii domain. the substitution was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis and was present in heterozygosis. additionally, one of the asymptomatic relatives (a girl 8 months old at the time of study) was identified as carrier of the same mutation and developed the DOID4MESHD004194 3 months later. the alteration found in the second exon of the gene in this family seems to be responsible for the DOID4MESHD004194, as all individuals harboring the mutation had been previously diagnosed or have eventually developed fndi. identification of the molecular OMIM188560 underlying fndi in affected families is a powerful tool for early asymptomatic diagnosis in infants.. 
3572301	sialophorin, a surface sialoglycoprotein defective in the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923, is involved in human t lymphocyte proliferation. the mab l10 was used to determine the distribution and the function of sialophorin, the heavily glycosylated surface molecule that is deficient/defective in lymphocytes of patients with the x-linked immunodeficiency OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923. dual-parameter facs analysis indicated that sialophorin is expressed on cd4 + and cd8 + lymphocytes, on a subpopulation of peripheral blood b lymphocytes, on all thymocytes, and on a subpopulation of bone marrow cells. functional studies demonstrated that l10 mab stimulates the proliferation of peripheral blood t lymphocytes as measured by stimulation of [3h] thymidine incorporation. the time course and magnitude of increased [3h] thymidine incorporation by t lymphocytes in response to l10 mab paralleled that induced by anti-cd3 mab. effective stimulation was dependent on the presence of monocytes and the fc portion of l10 mab. stimulation of lymphocytes by l10, like stimulation by anti-cd3 mab, involves increased expression of 4f2, hla-dr, and il-2-r. these observations suggest that sialophorin functions in t cell activation..

OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 (OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827) belongs to a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous DOID1289MESHD019636 characterized by progressive cerebellar MESHD001259. the DOID4MESHD004194-causing mutation has recently been identified as an unstable and expanded (cag) n trinucleotide repeat in a novel gene of unknown function. in caucasians, repeat expansions in the mjd1 gene have also been found in patients with the clinically distinct OMIM178110MESHC566739 DOID1441DOID0050957OMIM164400OMIM164500OMIM183086OMIM183090OMIM600223OMIM600224OMIM612876OMIM613728OMIM613908OMIM613909OMIM614153OMIM614229OMIM614322OMIM614831OMIM615386OMIM615705OMIM615768OMIM615957OMIM616053OMIM616127OMIM616204OMIM616354OMIM616410OMIM616719OMIM616795OMIM616948OMIM616949OMIM617018OMIM617133MESHD020754 type 3 (OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827). in order to gain insight into the biology of the mjd1/OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 gene we cloned the rat homologue and studied its expression. the rat and human ataxin-3 genes are highly homologous with an overall sequence identity of approximately 88%. however, the c-terminal end of the putative protein differs strongly from the published human sequence. the (cag) n block in the rat cdna consists of just three interrupted units suggesting that a long polyglutamine stretch is not essential for the normal function of the ataxin-3 protein in rodents. the expression pattern of the OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 gene in various rat and human tissues was investigated by northern blot analyses. the mature transcript is approximately 6 kb in length. in rat testis, a smaller transcript of 1. 3 kb was identified. transcription of rsca3 was detected in most rat tissues including brain. analyzing the expression level of the OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 gene in several human brain sections revealed no significant higher mrna level in regions predominantly affected in OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827. thus additional molecules and/or regulatory events are necessary to explain the exclusive degeneration of certain brain areas. 
7630639	the alveolar DOID3247MESHD012208 pax3/fkhr fusion protein is a transcriptional activator. chimeric transcription factors, created by gene fusions as the result of MESHD014178, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several pathologically disparate solid DOID162MESHD009369. the pax3/fkhr fusion gene, formed by a t (2; 13) (q35; q14) in alveolar DOID3247MESHD012208, encodes a hybrid protein that contains both pax3 dna binding domains, the paired box and homeodomain, linked to the bisected dna binding domain of fkhr, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. here we report that pax3 and pax3/fkhr display similar, but not identical transactivation activities when tested with model pax recognition sequences. no functional role could be ascribed solely to the residual fkhr binding domain present in the fusion protein, but fkhr was found to contribute a strong carboxyl terminal activation domain replacing the one located in the unrearranged pax3 gene. we show that the native pax3/fkhr protein present in DOID162MESHD009369 cells with this translocation has transcriptional characteristics similar to the in vitro expressed protein. the ability of the pax3/fkhr hybrid protein to bind dna in a sequence specific manner and to transactivate the expression of artificial reporter genes suggests that its aberrant expression could subvert the transcriptional programs that normally control the growth, differentiation, and survival of primitive myogenic precursors in vivo.. 
7581380	DOID2106OMIM255300OMIM255700MESHD009224 is a chloride channel disorder. the group of dominant non-dystrophic MESHD009222, comprising disorders characterized by clinically similar forms of myogenic muscle stiffness, is genetically inhomogeneous. dominant DOID2106OMIM255300OMIM255700MESHD009224 (DOID2106OMIM255300OMIM255700MESHD009224) is linked to clcn1, the gene encoding the major muscle chloride channel, localized on chromosome 7q35. in contrast, dominant MESHD009222 sensitive to potassium are caused by point mutations in scn4a on chromosome 17q, the gene for the alpha subunit of the adult skeletal muscle sodium channel. no linkage or molecular genetic data are as yet available on DOID2106OMIM255300OMIM255700MESHD009224 characterized by milder symptoms and later onset of MESHD009222 than in DOID2106OMIM255300OMIM255700MESHD009224, and absence of OMIM614160DOID0111072. we report a clcn1 gln-552-arg substitution for a family with dominant inheritance previously diagnosed to have DOID2106OMIM255300OMIM255700MESHD009224. thus, this disorder appears as a variant of DOID2106OMIM255300OMIM255700MESHD009224 due to mutations leading to low clinical expressivity. in addition, we report a novel ile-290-met clcn1 mutation for a typical thomsen pedigree. in another family previously diagnosed as having DOID2106OMIM255300OMIM255700MESHD009224, we unexpectedly found a clcn1 14 bp deletion known to cause recessive MESHD009222, and a rare trp-118-gly polymorphism.. 
8282802	markedly accelerated catabolism of apolipoprotein a-ii (apoa-ii) and high density lipoproteins containing apoa-ii in classic lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency and fish-eye DOID4MESHD004194. classic (complete) lecithin  cholesterol acyltransferase (lcat) deficiency and fish-eye DOID4MESHD004194 (partial OMIM245900DOID1391OMIM136120MESHD007863) are genetic DOID225MESHD013577 associated with markedly decreased plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol but not with an increased risk of atherosclerotic DOID1287MESHD002318. we investigated the metabolism of the hdl apolipoproteins (apo) apoa-i and apoa-ii in a total of five patients with OMIM245900DOID1391OMIM136120MESHD007863, one with classic OMIM245900DOID1391OMIM136120MESHD007863 and four with fish-eye DOID4MESHD004194. plasma levels of apoa-ii were decreased to a proportionately greater extent (23% of normal) than apoa-i (30% of normal). in addition, plasma concentrations of hdl particles containing both apoa-i and apoa-ii (lpa-i  a-ii) were much lower (18% of normal) than those of particles containing only apoa-i (lpa-i) (51% of normal). the metabolic basis for the low levels of apoa-ii and lpa-i  a-ii was investigated in all five patients using both exogenous radiotracer and endogenous stable isotope labeling techniques. the mean plasma residence time of apoa-i was decreased at 2. 08 +/- 0. 27 d (controls 4. 74 +/- 0. 65 days); however, the residence time of apoa-ii was even shorter at 1. 66 +/- 0. 24 d (controls 5. 25 +/- 0. 61 d). in addition, the catabolism of apoa-i in lpa-i  a-ii was substantially faster than that of apoa-i in lpa-i. in summary, genetic DOID225MESHD013577 of either complete or partial OMIM245900DOID1391OMIM136120MESHD007863 result in low levels of hdl through preferential hypercatabolism of apoa-ii and hdl particles containing apoa-ii. because lpa-i has been proposed to be more protective than lpa-i  a-ii against DOID1936DOID2348OMIM108725MESHD050197, this selective effect on the metabolism of lpa-i  a-ii may provide a potential explanation why patients with classic OMIM245900DOID1391OMIM136120MESHD007863 and fish-eye DOID4MESHD004194 are not at increased risk for premature DOID1936DOID2348OMIM108725MESHD050197 despite markedly decreased levels of hdl cholesterol and apoa-i

OMIM208400DOID0050461MESHD054880 (OMIM208400MESHD054880) is caused by deficient activity of the enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase (OMIM109200). the structural gene for OMIM109200 has been assigned to the region 4q21-qter of chromosome 4. we have studied the map position of the OMIM208400MESHD054880 locus in relation to other marker loci on the long arm of chromosome 4 using linkage analyses. restriction fragment length polymorphism alleles for the adh2, adh3, egf, fg alpha and fg beta loci and blood group antigens for the OMIM309350DOID0111788DOID12721DOID2256OMIM239100OMIM255800OMIM313400MESHD010009 locus were determined in a panel of 12 finnish OMIM208400MESHD054880 families. the heterozygous family members were identified by reduced activity of OMIM109200 in lymphocytes. linkage studies were performed using both pairwise and multipoint analyses. loose linkage of the OMIM208400MESHD054880 locus to the fg and OMIM309350DOID0111788DOID12721DOID2256OMIM239100OMIM255800OMIM313400MESHD010009 loci was observed (z = 1. 16, z = 1. 39, respectively). multipoint analysis to the fixed map [adh- (0. 03) -egf- (0. 35) -fg- (0. 11) -OMIM309350DOID0111788DOID12721DOID2256OMIM239100OMIM255800OMIM313400MESHD010009] suggests that the location of the OMIM208400MESHD054880 locus is 0. 05-0. 30 recombination units distal to OMIM309350DOID0111788DOID12721DOID2256OMIM239100OMIM255800OMIM313400MESHD010009 (z = 3. 03). the order cen-adh-egf-fg-OMIM309350DOID0111788DOID12721DOID2256OMIM239100OMIM255800OMIM313400MESHD010009-OMIM208400MESHD054880 is 35 times more likely than the next best order cen-adh-egf-OMIM208400MESHD054880-fg-OMIM309350DOID0111788DOID12721DOID2256OMIM239100OMIM255800OMIM313400MESHD010009. 
1671851	linkage analysis in DOID10588OMIM300100MESHD000326 and application in post- and prenatal diagnosis. we have performed linkage analysis with the dna markers dxs52 and the clotting factor viii gene (f8c), in several large families with DOID10588OMIM300100MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326). the tight linkage to dxs52 could be extended giving a maximal lod score of 22. 5 at 1 cm. f8c was also tightly linked to OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 with a maximal lod score of 7. 8 without recombination. multipoint linkage analysis with the markers dxs304, dxs52, and f8c indicated that both the gene for OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 and for f8c are distal to dxs52. in four patients with OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326, no major structural rearrangement in the xqter region was observed; in particular, there were no abnormalities in the vision DOID1432MESHD001766 genes. dna analysis appeared to be of use in determination of the carrier status of females at risk, for the determination of the origin of the mutation in a particular family, and for prenatal diagnosis.
10090890	multicentric origin of OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 gene (OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432) mutations. DOID2352OMIM235200MESHD006432 (gh) is believed to be a DOID4MESHD004194 restricted to those of european ancestry. in northwestern europe, > 80% of gh patients are homozygous for one mutation, the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at position 282 (c282y) in the unprocessed protein. in a proportion of gh patients, two mutations are present, c282y and h63d. the clinical significance of this second mutation is such that it appears to predispose 1% -2% of compound heterozygotes to expression of the DOID4MESHD004194. the distribution of the two mutations differ, c282y being limited to those of northwestern european ancestry and h63d being found at allele frequencies > 5%, in europe, in countries bordering the mediterranean, in the middle east, and in the indian subcontinent. the c282y mutation occurs on a haplotype that extends </= 6 mb, suggesting that this mutation has arisen during the past 2, 000 years. the h63d mutation is older and does not occur on such a large extended haplotype, the haplotype in this case extending </= 700 kb. here we report the finding of the h63d and c282y mutations on new haplotypes. in sri lanka we have found h63d on three new haplotypes and have found c282y on one new haplotype, demonstrating that these mutations have arisen independently on this island. these results suggest that the OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 gene has been the subject of selection pressure. these selection pressures could be due to MESHD003141, environmental conditions,  or other DOID630MESHD030342 such as DOID2355MESHD000740.
3563511	identification and localization of mutations at the lesch-nyhan locus by ribonuclease a cleavage. many mutations leading to human DOID4MESHD004194 are the result of single dna base pair changes that cannot be identified by southern analysis. this has prompted the development of alternative assays for point mutation detection. the recently described ribonuclease a cleavage procedure, with a polyuridylic acid-paper affinity chromatography step, has been used to identify the mutational lesions in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) messenger rnas of patients with OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926. distinctive ribonuclease a cleavage patterns were identified in messenger rna from 5 of 14 lesch-nyhan patients who were chosen because no hprt southern or northern blotting pattern changes had been found. this approach now allows hprt mutation detection in 50 percent of the cases of OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926. the polyuridylic acid-paper affinity procedure provides a general method for analysis of low abundance messenger rnas.. 
10364520	mefv-gene analysis in armenian patients with familial mediterranean MESHD005334: diagnostic value and unfavorable renal prognosis of the m694v homozygous genotype-genetic and therapeutic implications. familial mediterranean MESHD005334 (OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505) is a recessively inherited disorder that is common in patients of armenian ancestry. to date, its diagnosis, which can be made only retrospectively, is one of exclusion, based entirely on nonspecific clinical signs that result from serosal MESHD007249 and that may lead to unnecessary surgery. renal DOID9120MESHD000686, prevented by colchicine, is the most severe complication of OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505, a disorder associated with mutations in the mefv gene. to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of mefv-gene analysis, we investigated 90 armenian OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 patients from 77 unrelated families that were not selected through genetic-linkage analysis. eight mutations, one of which (r408q) is new, were found to account for 93% of the 163 independent OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 alleles, with both OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 alleles identified in 89% of the patients. in several instances, family studies provided molecular evidence for pseudodominant transmission and incomplete penetrance of the DOID4MESHD004194 phenotype. the m694v homozygous genotype was found to be associated with a higher prevalence of renal DOID9120MESHD000686 and DOID848MESHD001168, compared with other genotypes (p =. 0002 and p =. 006, respectively). the demonstration of both the diagnostic and prognostic value of mefv analysis and particular modes of inheritance should lead to new ways for management of OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505-including genetic counseling and therapeutic decisions in affected families.
7568002	identification and localization of huntingtin in brain and human lymphoblastoid cell lines with anti-fusion protein antibodies. the OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 (hd) phenotype is associated with expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the it15 gene, which is predicted to encode a 348-kda protein named huntington. we used polyclonal and monoclonal anti-fusion protein antibodies to identify native huntingtin in rat, monkey, and human. western blots revealed a protein with the expected molecular weight which is present in the soluble fraction of rat and monkey brain tissues and lymphoblastoid cells from control cases. in lymphoblastoid cell lines from juvenile-onset heterozygote hd cases, both normal and mutant huntingtin are expressed, and increasing repeat expansion leads to lower levels of the mutant protein. immunocytochemistry indicates that huntingtin is located in neurons throughout the brain, with the highest levels evident in larger neurons. in the human striatum, huntingtin is enriched in a patch-like distribution, potentially corresponding to the first areas affected in hd. subcellular localization of huntingtin is consistent with a cytosolic protein primarily found in somatodendritic regions. huntingtin appears to particularly associate with microtubules, although some is also associated with synaptic vesicles. on the basis of the localization of huntingtin in association with microtubules, we speculate that the mutation impairs the cytoskeletal anchoring or transport of mitochondria, vesicles, or other organelles or molecules.. 
1319838	correlation between the location of germ-line mutations in the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene and the number of colorectal MESHD011127 in DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 patients. recently we have isolated the DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125) gene which causes DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM105210), and its germ-line mutations in a substantial number of OMIM105210 patients have been identified. on the basis of this information, we compared the location of germ-line mutations in the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene in 22 unrelated patients (12 of whom have been reported previously) with the number of colorectal MESHD011127 developed in OMIM105210 patients; 17 were sparse types and five were profuse types. all but one of the mutations were considered to cause truncation of the gene product by frame-shift due to deletion (14 cases) or nonsense mutation (seven cases). the location of the germ-line mutations seems to correlate with the two clinical types; germ-line mutations in five OMIM105210 patients with profuse MESHD011127 were observed between codon 1250 and codon 1464, whereas mutations in 17 OMIM105210 patients with fewer MESHD011127 were observed in the other regions of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene. the result suggests that the number of colorectal MESHD011127 in OMIM105210 patients may be associated with a difference in the stability or biological function of the truncated OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 protein.. 
10480348	duchenne/becker DOID9884MESHD009136: correlation of phenotype by electroretinography with sites of dystrophin mutations. the dark-adapted electroretinogram (erg) of patients with duchenne and becker DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388/OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826) shows a marked reduction in b-wave amplitude. genotype-phenotype studies of mouse models for OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 show position-specific effects of the mutations upon the phenotype  mice with 5 defects of dystrophin have normal ergs, those with defects in the central region have a normal b-wave amplitude associated with prolonged implicit times for both the b-wave and oscillatory potentials, and mice with 3 defects have a phenotype similar to that seen in  OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388/OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826 patients. the mouse studies suggest a key role for the carboxyl terminal dystrophin isoform, dp260, in retinal electrophysiology. we have undertaken a systematic evaluation of OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388/OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826 patients through clinical examination and review of the literature in order to determine whether the position-specific effects of mutations noted in the mouse are present in man. we have found that, in man, a wider variation of OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 defects correlate with reductions in the b-wave amplitude. individuals with normal ergs have mutations predominantly located 5 of the transcript initiation site of dp260. our results suggest that the most important determinant in the erg b-wave phenotype is the mutation position, rather than muscle DOID4MESHD004194 severity. forty-six per cent of patients with mutations 5 of the dp260 transcript start site have abnormal ergs, as opposed to 94% with more distal mutations. the human genotype-phenotype correlations are consistent with a role for dp260 in normal retinal electrophysiology and may also reflect the expression of other c-terminal dystrophin isoforms and their contributions to retinal signal transmission.. 
1610789	molecular characterization of two DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 mutations and one polymorphism: implications for structure-function analysis of human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. we report here the molecular characterization of two DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 mutations, l74p and f171s, and one polymorphism, s135l, in human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (galt). both DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 mutations result in reduced enzymatic activity when reconstructed in the cdna and overexpressed. the polymorphism, in contrast, has near normal activity. both mutations affect evolutionarily conserved residues, suggesting that they are functionally important, while the polymorphism occurs in a nonconserved domain which is presumably not critical for enzymatic function. the f171s mutation is close to the putative active-site nucleophile. our data further support the notion of molecular heterogeneity of DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 and suggest that DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 mutations and galt polymorphisms may be useful tools in highlighting different functional domains in human galt.. 
10777718	DOID1926OMIM230800OMIM230900OMIM231000MESHD005776: the origins of the ashkenazi jewish n370s and 84gg acid beta-glucosidase mutations. type 1 DOID1926OMIM230800OMIM230900OMIM231000MESHD005776 (gd), a non-neuronopathic lysosomal storage disorder, results from the deficient activity of acid beta-glucosidase (gba). type 1 DOID4MESHD004194 is panethnic but is more prevalent in individuals of ashkenazi jewish (aj) descent. of the causative gba mutations, n370s is particularly frequent in the aj population, (q approximately. 03), whereas the 84gg insertion (q approximately. 003) occurs exclusively in the ashkenazim. to investigate the genetic history of these mutations in the aj population, short tandem repeat (str) markers were used to map a 9. 3-cm region containing the gba locus and to genotype 261 aj n370s chromosomes, 60 european non-jewish n370s chromosomes, and 62 aj 84gg chromosomes. a highly conserved haplotype at four markers flanking gba (pklr, d1s1595, d1s2721, and d1s2777) was observed on both the aj chromosomes and the non-jewish n370s chromosomes, suggesting the occurrence of a founder common to both populations. of note, the presence of different divergent haplotypes suggested the occurrence of de novo, recurrent n370s mutations. in contrast, a different conserved haplotype at these markers was identified on the 84gg chromosomes, which was unique to the aj population. on the basis of the linkage disequilibrium (ld) delta values, the non-jewish european n370s chromosomes had greater haplotype diversity and less ld at the markers flanking the conserved haplotype than did the aj n370s chromosomes. this finding is consistent with the presence of the n370s mutation in the non-jewish european population prior to the founding of the aj population. coalescence analyses for the n370s and 84gg mutations estimated similar coalescence times, of 48 and 55.5 generations ago, respectively. the results of these studies are consistent with a significant bottleneck occurring in the aj population during the first millennium, when the population became established in europe. 
8209890	investigation of thermoregulatory characteristics in patients with OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. a survey instrument is used to assess temperature regulation characteristics in children with OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218) compared to 3 control groups  sibs of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 patients (sib), neurodevelopmentally handicapped children (nd), and age and gender matched well children (wc). significant differences were found between OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 patients, sib controls, and wc controls in the prevalence of MESHD003294, MESHD005334-associated symptoms, and temperature less than 94 degrees f. no differences were noted in any variable between the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 patients and the nd controls, suggesting that these abnormalities are not unique to OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218, but can occur in any neurodevelopmentally handicapped individual, further suggesting these do not necessarily reflect DOID225MESHD013577-specific hypothalamic abnormalities.. 
7298854	abnormal high density lipoproteins in OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294. the plasma lipoprotein profiles and high density lipoproteins (hdl) were characterized in patients with the DOID630MESHD030342 OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294 (OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294). abnormalities in the hdl may contribute to their increased DOID2348OMIM108725MESHD050197 and excessive deposits of tissue sterols in the presence of low or low-normal concentrations of plasma cholesterol (165 +/- 25 mg/dl) and low density lipoproteins (ldl). the mean hdl-cholesterol concentration in the OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294 plasmas was 14. 5 +/- 3. 2 mg/dl, about one-third the normal value. the low hdl-cholesterol reflects a low concentration and an abnormal lipid composition of the plasma hdl. relative to normal hdl, the cholesteryl esters are low, free cholesterol and phospholipids essentially normal, and triglycerides increased. the ratio of apoprotein (apo) to total cholesterol in the hdl of OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294 was two to three times greater than normal. in the OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294 hdl, the ratio of apoai to apoaii was high, the proportion of apoc low, and a normally minor form of apoai increased relative to other forms. the hdl in electron micrographs appeared normal morphologically and in particle size. the abnormalities in lipoprotein distribution profile and composition of the plasma hdl result from metabolic defects that are not understood but may be linked to the genetic OMIM188560 in bile acid synthesis in OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294. as a consequence, it is probable that the normal functions of the hdl, possibly including modulation of ldl-cholesterol uptake and the removal of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues, are perturbed significantly in this DOID4MESHD004194.
10330348	splicing defects in the MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 gene, atm: underlying mutations and consequences. mutations resulting in defective splicing constitute a significant proportion (30/62 [48%]) of a new series of mutations in the atm gene in patients with MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 (at) that were detected by the protein-truncation assay followed by sequence analysis of genomic dna. fewer than half of the splicing mutations involved the canonical ag splice-acceptor site or gt splice-donor site. a higher percentage of mutations occurred at less stringently conserved sites, including silent mutations of the last nucleotide of exons, mutations in nucleotides other than the conserved ag and gt in the consensus splice sites, and creation of splice-acceptor or splice-donor sites in either introns or exons. these splicing mutations led to a variety of consequences, including exon skipping and, to a lesser degree, intron retention, activation of cryptic splice sites, or creation of new splice sites. in addition, 5 of 12 nonsense mutations and 1 missense mutation were associated with deletion in the cdna of the exons in which the mutations occurred. no atm protein was detected by western blotting in any at cell line in which splicing mutations were identified. several cases of exon skipping in both normal controls and patients for whom no underlying OMIM188560 could be found in genomic dna were also observed, suggesting caution in the interpretation of exon deletions observed in atm cdna when there is no accompanying identification of genomic mutations.. 
10593994	mutations of the cathepsin c gene are responsible for OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214. OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214 (OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and severe DOID9893OMIM170650MESHD010520 that results in the premature loss of the primary and secondary dentitions. a major gene locus for OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214 has been mapped to a 2. 8 cm interval on chromosome 11q14. correlation of physical and genetic maps of this interval indicate it includes at least 40 ests and six known genes including the lysosomal protease cathepsin c gene (ctsc). the ctsc message is expressed at high levels in a variety of immune cells including polymorphonuclear leucocytes, macrophages, and their precursors. by rt-pcr, we found ctsc is also expressed in epithelial regions commonly affected by OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214, including the palms, soles, knees, and oral keratinised gingiva. the 4. 7 kb ctsc gene consists of two exons. sequence analysis of ctsc from subjects affected with OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214 from five consanguineous turkish families identified four different mutations. an exon 1 nonsense mutation (856c-- > t) introduces a premature stop codon at amino acid 286. three exon 2 mutations were identified, including a single nucleotide deletion (2692dela) of codon 349 introducing a frameshift and premature termination codon, a 2 bp deletion (2673-2674delct) that results in introduction of a stop codon at amino acid 343, and a g-- > a substitution in codon 429 (2931g-- > a) introducing a premature termination codon. all OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214 patients were homozygous for cathepsin c mutations inherited from a common ancestor. parents and sibs heterozygous for cathepsin c mutations do not show either the palmoplantar hyperkeratosis or severe DOID9893OMIM170650MESHD010520 characteristic of OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214. a more complete understanding of the functional physiology of cathepsin c carries significant implications for understanding normal and abnormal skin development and DOID3388MESHD010510 susceptibility 
2910902	identification of a single nucleotide change in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (hprtyale) responsible for OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926. complete deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) causes the OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926. previous characterization of a mutant form of hprt, hprtyale, from a subject with the OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926 revealed normal mrna and protein concentrations, no residual catalytic activity, and cathodal migration upon page. we have cloned and sequenced hprtyale cdna. the nucleotide sequence of full-length hprtyale cdna revealed a single nucleotide substitution compared with normal hprt cdna  g----c at nucleotide position 211. this transversion predicts substitution of arginine for glycine at amino acid position 71, explaining the cathodal migration of hprtyale. chou-fasman secondary structure analysis predicts a change in the probability of beta-turn formation in the region containing the mutation. inclusion of the bulky arginine side chain in place of glycine probably disrupts protein folding as well. cloning mutant forms of cdna allows identification of specific mutations, provides insight into mutational mechanisms, and facilitates structure-function analysis of mutant proteins.. 
2927388	molecular detection of MESHD014178 that disrupt the putative OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 susceptibility locus. a candidate dna sequence with many of the properties predicted for the OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 susceptibility (OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175) locus has been cloned (s. h. friend, r. bernards, s. rogelj, r. a. weinberg, j. m. rapaport, d. m. albert, and t. p. dryja, nature [london] 323  643-645, 1986). the large size of this gene (ca. 200 kilobases [kb]) and its multiple dispersed exons (wiggs et al., n. engl. j. med. 318  151-157, 1988) complicate molecular screening strategies important in prenatal and presymptomatic diagnosis and in carrier detection. here we used field inversion gel electrophoresis (fige) to construct a restriction map of approximately 1, 000 kb of dna surrounding the OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 locus and to detect the translocation breakpoints in three OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 patients. dna probes from either the 5 or 3 end of the gene were used to detect a 250-kb eagi restriction fragment in dna from unaffected individuals. both probes identified an additional hybridizing fragment in the dna from each patient, permitting the breakpoints in all three to be mapped within the cloned OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 gene. analysis of the breakpoint in one translocation cell line allowed the OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 gene to be oriented with its 5 end toward the centromere. the 5 end of the gene also appeared to be associated with a clustering of sites for several infrequently cleaving restriction enzymes, indicating the presence of an hpaii tiny fragment island. the detection and mapping of the translocation breakpoints of all three OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 patients to within the putative OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 gene substantiated the authenticity of this candidate sequence and demonstrated the utility of fige in detecting chromosomal rearrangements affecting this locus. 
1338906	constitutional mutations in the OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 gene in patients with OMIM194080DOID3764MESHD030321. the OMIM194080DOID3764MESHD030321 is characterised by a typical DOID557, genital abnormalities and also predisposes to the development of wilms DOID162MESHD009369. these patients eventually go into end stage DOID1074MESHD051437. a candidate wilms DOID162MESHD009369 gene, OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396, from the 11p13 chromosome region has recently been cloned. we have analysed the dna sequence in constitutional cells from eight patients and have shown heterozygous mutations in six of them. four of the mutations were in exon 9, all resulting in missense mutations. three were at nucleotide position 1180 resulting in an arg > trp amino acid change. the other was at position 1186 converting an asp > asn in the predicted resultant protein. one patient had a missense mutation in exon 8, converting an arg > his. a single base pair insertion at nucleotide position 821 in exon 6 resulted in the generation of a premature stop codon in the last patient. we were unable to find a mutation in one patient despite complete sequencing of the genomic sequence of the gene. the last patient carried a constitutional deletion of the 11p13 region and no additional mutation was found. there was no obvious correlation between the type of mutation and phenotypic expression. these results further demonstrate that the OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 gene is important in both the development of the kidney and the genito-urinary system.. 
8198124	four novel OMIM167400DOID0111537MESHC563475 alleles causing OMIM170100DOID0111540MESHD056732. mutations at the OMIM167400DOID0111537MESHC563475 locus cause OMIM170100DOID0111540MESHD056732 (mckusick 170100), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by iminodipeptiduria, skin MESHD014456, DOID1059MESHD008607, and recurrent MESHD007239. four OMIM167400DOID0111537MESHC563475 mutations from five severely affected individuals were characterized by analysis of reverse-transcribed, pcr-amplified (rt-pcr) cdna. we used sscp analysis on four overlapping cdna fragments covering the entire coding region of the OMIM167400DOID0111537MESHC563475 gene and detected abnormal sscp bands for the fragment spanning all or part of exons 13-15 in three of the probands. direct sequencing of the mutant cdnas showed a g-- > a, 1342 substitution (g448r) in two patients and a 3-bp deletion (delta e452 or delta e453) in another. in the other two probands the amplified products were of reduced size. direct sequencing of these mutant cdnas revealed a deletion of exon 5 in one patient and of exon 7 in the other. intronic sequences flanking exons 5 and 7 were identified using inverse pcr followed by direct sequencing. conventional pcr and direct sequencing then established the intron-exon borders of the mutant genomic dna revealing two splice acceptor mutations  a g-- > c substitution at position -1 of intron 4 and an a-- > g substitution at position -2 of intron 6. our results indicate that the severe form of OMIM170100DOID0111540MESHD056732 is caused by multiple OMIM167400DOID0111537MESHC563475 alleles. in this report we attempt to begin the process of describing these alleles and cataloging their phenotypic expression.. 
2817003	translocation t(5;11)(q13.1;p13) associated with familial isolated DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783. a father and daughter with isolated DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 were observed to have an apparently balanced, reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 5 and 11 [t (5; 11) (q13. 1; p13)]. no other clinical characteristics often associated with the deletion of 11p13 were observed in this family. this finding, in association with 3 other instances of single breaks at 11p13 and DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783, supports the assignment of OMIM617141DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617142MESHD015783 to 11p13. 
10382909	genotype-phenotype analysis in x-linked emery-dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136 and identification of a missense mutation associated with a milder phenotype. direct sequencing of the emerin gene in 22 families with emery-dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136 (emd) revealed mutations in 21 (95%), confirming that emerin mutations can be identified in the majority of families with x-linked emd. most emerin mutations result in absence of the protein. in this study three mutations (a missense mutation pro183thr and two in-frame deletions removing residues 95-99 and 236-241, respectively) were unusual in being associated with expression of mutant protein. the phenotype in these families was compared in detail with the clinical features in cases with typical null mutations. for the in-frame deletions there were no significant differences. in the family with the missense mutation the phenotype was milder. age at onset was later for first symptoms and for development of ankle MESHD003286 and MESHD018908. these findings have diagnostic implications as well as pointing to functionally important regions of the emerin protein..

3600794	localization of the region homologous to the duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 locus on the mouse x chromosome. recent progress has resulted in part of the gene mutated in duchenne and the milder becker DOID9884MESHD009136 being cloned and has suggested that the gene itself extends over 1, 000 to 2, 000 kilobases (kb). to study how mutations in this gene affect muscle development and integrity, it would be of interest to have available a mouse model of the human DOID4MESHD004194. the mouse OMIM309200MESHC564108 mutation affects muscle and confers a mild dystrophic DOID225MESHD013577, but it is not clear whether this mutation is equivalent to duchenne/becker DOID9884MESHD009136 in man. here we describe the use of two sequences from the human duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) gene that cross-hybridize to mouse x-linked sequences to localize the gene homologous to OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 in the mouse. both sequences map to the region of 10 centimorgan lying between the tabby (ta) and st14-1 (dxpas8) loci, close to the phosphorylase b kinase locus (phk). by analogy with the human x-chromosome, we conclude that the region in the mouse around the g6pd and st14-1 loci may contain two genes corresponding to distinct human DOID423MESHD009135  emery dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136 which is known to be closely linked to st14-1 in man and the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 homologue described here.. 
1301937	molecular basis of OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 and pseudodeficiency in the berks county pennsylvania dutch. following the birth of two infants with OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 (OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661), a non-jewish, pennsylvania dutch kindred was screened for OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 carriers using the biochemical assay. a high frequency of individuals who appeared to be OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 heterozygotes was detected (kelly et al., 1975). clinical and biochemical evidence suggested that the increased carrier frequency was due to at least two altered alleles for the hexosaminidase a alpha-subunit. we now report two mutant alleles in this pennsylvania dutch kindred, and one polymorphism. one allele, reported originally in a french OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 patient (akli et al., 1991), is a gt-- > at transition at the donor splice-site of intron 9. the second, a c-- > t transition at nucleotide 739 (arg247trp), has been shown by triggs-raine et al. (1992) to be a clinically benign " pseudodeficient " allele associated with reduced enzyme activity against artificial substrate. finally, a polymorphism [g-- > a (759)], which leaves valine at codon 253 unchanged, is described .
3856322	gene transfer and expression of human phenylalanine hydroxylase. OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 (OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661) is caused by a genetic deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600). a full-length complementary dna clone of human OMIM178600 was inserted into a eukaryotic expression vector and transferred into mouse nih3t3 cells which do not normally express OMIM178600. the transformed mouse cells expressed OMIM178600 messenger rna, immunoreactive protein, and enzymatic activity that are characteristic of the normal human liver products, demonstrating that a single gene contains all of the necessary genetic information to code for functional OMIM178600. these results support the use of the human OMIM178600 probe in prenatal diagnosis and detection of carriers, to provide new opportunities for the biochemical characterization of normal and mutant enzymes, and in the investigation of alternative genetic therapies for OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661.. 
8302543	DOID10871DOID4448MESHD008268 associated with mutations at codon 172 in the human DOID8466MESHD012162 slow gene. background  recently, mutations in the DOID8466MESHD012162 slow (rds) gene which codes for peripherin-rds have been implicated as a cause of OMIM178110MESHC566739 DOID3612DOID10176MESHD012173 pigmentosa. because this gene is expressed in both rods and cones, mutations in the rds gene might be expected to cause degeneration affecting either the scotopic or photopic systems. mutations at codon 172 of the rds gene have been identified in three families with autosomal dominantly inherited, progressive DOID10871DOID4448MESHD008268. methods  affected individuals underwent ophthalmic examination, scotopic perimetry, dark adaptometry, measurement of color-contrast sensitivity, and electroretinography to characterize the photoreceptor dysfunction. results  in all but one affected member, symptoms of progressive central visual loss developed in the third or fourth decade of life accompanied by MESHD012607 and well-demarcated MESHD001284 of the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris of the macula. in general, cone and rod thresholds were elevated, and color-contrast sensitivity was absent in the central visual field. peripherally, the scotopic sensitivities were normal, as was the recovery from bleach. cone electroretinograms were diminished in amplitude, and delayed in all affected adults except one. rod electroretinograms were normal or near normal in amplitude, and had normal implicit times. affected asymptomatic children had macular changes, abnormal color-contrast sensitivity, and reduced pattern and cone electroretinograms. conclusion  these results indicate that mutations in the rds gene can be expressed as a DOID10871DOID4448MESHD008268, with evidence of primary cone dysfunction and preservation of peripheral rod function.. 
23402	glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants: gd (+) alexandra associated with DOID2383MESHD007567 and gd (-) camperdown in a young man with lamellar MESHD002386. two male subjects are described, with unusual clinical presentations and with hitherto undescribed g6pd variants. the first, of italian extraction, suffered from severe DOID2383MESHD007567 following maternal ingestion of fresh broad beans (vicia fava) both prenatally and postnatally  the expression of the enzymatic OMIM188560 was much more severe in the neonatal period than on retesting in adolescence, when biochemical characterization showed unique features which justify designation as a new variant gd (+) alexandra. the second patient, a boy of maltese extraction who was found to have bilateral lamellar MESHD002386 at the age of 4 years, was identified as g6pd deficient only as a result of a survey of children of mediterranean origin with unexplained DOID83MESHD002386 formation; he has approximately 15% of normal enzyme activity, with another unique combination of biochemical characteristics which has led to its designation as gd (-) camperdown. although this association may be coincidental, it prompts further attention to the possibility that under certain circumstances DOID2862MESHD005955 may favor DOID83MESHD002386 formation. the two cases illustrate the value of characterization of the mutant enzyme whenever unexpected clinical or laboratory results are obtained.. 
2989709	dna restriction fragments associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin indicate a single origin for deficiency allele pi z. the alpha 1-protease inhibitor, or alpha-antitrypsin (aat), a major plasma inhibitor of leukocyte elastase and bacterial proteases, is encoded at the pi locus on chromosome 14 (14q24. 3-q32. 1). a deficiency of aat in individuals homozygous for the pi z allele occurs in about 1 in 2, 000-8, 000 caucasians and is associated with an increased risk of early adult onset MESHD004646 and DOID409MESHD008107 in childhood. we have now used dna polymorphisms associated with the aat gene to investigate the origin of the pi z allele. using two genomic probes extending into the 5 and 3 flanking regions, respectively, we have identified eight polymorphic restriction sites. extensive linkage disequilibrium occurs throughout the probed region with the pi z allele, but not with normal pi m alleles. the z allele occurs mainly with one haplotype, indicating a single, relatively recent, origin in caucasians 
10976074	OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 in transgenic mice expressing an expanded cug repeat. OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm), the most common form of DOID9884MESHD009136 in adult humans, results from expansion of a ctg repeat in the 3 untranslated region of the dmpk gene. the mutant dmpk messenger rna (mrna) contains an expanded cug repeat and is retained in the nucleus. we have expressed an untranslated cug repeat in an unrelated mrna in transgenic mice. mice that expressed expanded cug repeats developed MESHD009222 and DOID423MESHD009135, whereas mice expressing a nonexpanded repeat did not. thus, transcripts with expanded cug repeats are sufficient to generate a dm phenotype. this result supports a role for rna gain of function in DOID4MESHD004194 pathogenesis.. 
10797418	submicroscopic deletion in cousins with OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 causes a grandmatrilineal inheritance pattern: effects of imprinting. the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218) critical region on 15q11-q13 is subject to imprinting. OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 becomes apparent when genes on the paternally inherited chromosome are not expressed. familial OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 is rare. we report on a family in which a male and a female paternal first cousin both have OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 with cytogenetically normal karyotypes. fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) analysis shows a submicroscopic deletion of snrpn, but not the closely associated loci d15s10, d15s11, d15s63, and gabrb3. the cousins fathers and two paternal aunts have the same deletion and are clinically normal. the grandmother of the cousins is deceased and not available for study, and their grandfather is not deleted for snrpn. dna methylation analysis of d15s63 is consistent with an abnormality of the imprinting center associated with OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. " grandmatrilineal " inheritance occurs when a woman with deletion of an imprinted, paternally expressed gene is at risk of having affected grandchildren through her sons. in this case, OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 does not become evident as long as the deletion is passed through the matrilineal line. this represents a unique inheritance pattern due to imprinting.. 
10915770	expression and imprinting of magel2 suggest a role in OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 and the homologous murine imprinting phenotype. OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218) is caused by the loss of expression of imprinted genes in chromosome 15q11-q13. affected individuals exhibit neonatal MESHD009123, developmental delay and childhood-onset OMIM601665OMIM618406DOID9970MESHD009765. necdin, a protein implicated in the terminal differentiation of neurons, is the only OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 candidate gene to reduce viability when disrupted in a mouse model. in this study, we have characterized magel2 (also known as ndnl1), a gene with 51% amino acid sequence similarity to necdin and located 41 kb distal to ndn in the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 deletion region. magel2 is expressed predominantly in brain, the primary tissue affected in OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 and in several fetal tissues as shown by northern blot analysis. magel2 is imprinted with monoallelic expression in control brain, and paternal-only expression in the central nervous system as demonstrated by its lack of expression in brain from a OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218-affected individual. the orthologous mouse gene (magel2) is located within 150 kb of ndn , is imprinted with paternal-only expression and is expressed predominantly in late developmental stages and adult brain as shown by northern blotting, rt-pcr and whole-mount rna in situ hybridization. magel2 distribution partially overlaps that of ndn , with strong expression being detected in the central nervous system in mid-gestation mouse embryos by in situ hybridization. we hypothesize that, although loss of necdin expression may be important in the neonatal presentation of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218, loss of magel2 may be critical to abnormalities in brain development and dysmorphic features in individuals with OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218.. 
1968617	a single origin of OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 in yemenite jews. OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 (OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661) is a DOID0014667MESHD008659 caused by recessive mutations of the gene encoding the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600). the incidence of OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 varies widely across different geographic areas, and is highest (about 1 in 5, 000 live births) in ireland and western scotland, and among yemenite jews. a limited number of point mutations account for most of the OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 cases in the european population. here we report that a single molecular OMIM188560--a deletion spanning the third exon of the OMIM178600 gene--is responsible for all the OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 cases among the yemenite jews. examination of a random sample of yemenite jews using a molecular probe that detects the carriers of this deletion indicated a high frequency of the defective gene in this community. although the deleted OMIM178600 gene was traced to 25 different locations throughout yemen, family histories and official documents of the yemenite jewish community showed that the common ancestor of all the carriers of this genetic OMIM188560 lived in sana, the capital of yemen, before the eighteenth century.. 
7909252	high resolution genetic analysis suggests one ancestral predisposing haplotype for the origin of the OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 mutation. the mutation causing OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) has been identified as an amplification of an unstable trinucleotide (ctg) n repeat in over 99% of the global dm population. it is in complete linkage disequilibrium with an alu element polymorphism within the dm kinase gene, suggesting that dm is a consequence of one or few ancestral mutations. a recent analysis utilizing this polymorphism as well as a flanking dinucleotide marker, suggested that similar to OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600, dm exhibited a founder effect (imbert et al., 1993 nature genet. 4, 72-76). in contrast, the low reproductive fitness of individuals with congenital dm (the endpoint of MESHD020132 in OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223) suggests a higher rate of new mutations. we present a high resolution genetic analysis of the dm locus using pcr based assays of nine polymorphisms, spanning a physical distance of 30 kb, within and immediately flanking the dm kinase gene. the persistent complete allelic association of the dm mutation with all these polymorphisms provides further support to previous observations and suggests more strongly that the dm mutation occurred on the background of a particular haplotype in which the (ctg) n repeat became inherently unstable and therefore predisposed to amplification. 
1322637	identification and rapid detection of three tay-sachs mutations in the moroccan jewish population. infantile OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 (OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661) is caused by mutations in the hexa gene that result in the complete absence of beta-hexosaminidase a activity. it is well known that an elevated frequency of OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 mutations exists among ashkenazi jews. more recently it has become apparent that elevated carrier frequencies for OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 also occur in several other ethnic groups, including moroccan jews, a subgroup of sephardic jews. elsewhere we reported an in-frame deletion of one of the two adjacent phenylalanine codons at position 304 or 305 (delta f304/305) in one hexa allele of a moroccan jewish OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 patient and in three obligate carriers from six unrelated moroccan jewish families. we have now identified two additional mutations within exon 5 of the hexa gene that account for the remaining OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 alleles in the patient and carriers. one of the mutations is a novel c-to-g transversion, resulting in a replacement of tyr180 by a stop codon. the other mutation is a g-to-a transition resulting in an arg170-to-gln substitution. this mutation is at a cpg site in a japanese infant with OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 and was described elsewhere. analysis of nine obligate carriers from seven unrelated families showed that four harbor the delta f304/305 mutation, two the arg170----gln mutation, and one the tyr180----stop mutation. we also have developed rapid, nonradioactive assays for the detection of each mutation, which should be helpful for carrier screening.. 
7490097	mapping of the mouse homologue of the OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527 gene to mouse chromosome 8. atp7b, the gene altered in OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527 (wd) patients, lies in a block of homology shared between human chromosome 13q14 and the central region of mouse chromosome 14. however, we have mapped the murine homologue of atp7b (atp7b) to mouse chromosome 8 by somatic cell hybrid analysis. analysis of 80 interspecific backcross offspring was used to position atp7b close to d8mit3 and another atpase locus, atp4b, on mouse chromosome 8. atp4b lies in 13q34 and is separated from atp7b by several loci whose mouse homologues map to mouse chromosome 14. the assignment of atp7b to mouse chromosome 8 identifies a previously unrecognized region of homology between this chromosome and human chromosome 13. this assignment suggests a possible location for the toxic milk mutation in the mouse, which has been proposed as a homologue of wd.. 
8116611	characteristics of intergenerational contractions of the ctg repeat in OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223. in OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm), the size of a ctg repeat in the dm kinase gene generally increases in successive generations with clinical evidence of anticipation. however, there have also been cases with an intergenerational contraction of the repeat. we examined 1, 489 dm parent-offspring pairs, of which 95 (6. 4%) showed such contractions in peripheral blood leukocytes (pbl). in 56 of the 95 pairs, clinical data allowed an analysis of their anticipation status. it is surprising that anticipation occurred in 27 (48%) of these 56 pairs, while none clearly showed a later onset of dm in the symptomatic offspring. the contraction occurred in 76 (10%) of 753 paternal transmissions and in 19 (3%) of 736 maternal transmissions. anticipation was observed more frequently in maternal (85%) than in paternal (37%) transmissions (p <. 001). the parental repeat size correlated with the size of intergenerational contraction (r2 =. 50, p < <. 001), and the slope of linear regression was steeper in paternal (-. 62) than in maternal (-. 30) transmissions (p < <. 001). sixteen dm parents had multiple dm offspring with the ctg repeat contractions. this frequency was higher than the frequency expected from the probability of the repeat contractions (6. 4%) and the size of dm sib population (1. 54 dm offspring per dm parent, in 968 dm parents). we conclude that (1) intergenerational contractions of the ctg repeat in leukocyte dna frequently accompanies apparent anticipation, especially when dm is maternally transmitted, and (2) the paternal origin of the repeat and the presence of the repeat contraction in a sibling increase the probability of the ctg repeat contraction 
10571950	splice-site mutation in the OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648 gene may result in intrafamilial variability for MESHD003638 in OMIM274600DOID0060744MESHC536648. OMIM274600DOID0060744MESHC536648 is a recessive inherited disorder that consists of developmental abnormalities of the cochlea, DOID10003MESHD006319, and diffuse thyroid enlargement (DOID12176MESHD006042). this disorder may account for up to 10% of cases of hereditary MESHD003638. the DOID4MESHD004194 gene (OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648) has been mapped to chromosome 7q22-q31, and encodes a chloride-iodide transport protein. we performed mutation analysis of individual exons of the OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648 gene in one spanish family that shows intrafamilial variability of the MESHD003638 phenotype (two patients with profound and one with moderate-severe MESHD003638). we identified a new splice-site mutation affecting intron 4 of the OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648 gene, at nucleotide position 639 + 7. rna analysis from lymphocytes of the affected patients showed that mutation 639 + 7a-- > g generates a new donor splice site, leading to an mrna with an insertion of six nucleotides from intron 4 of OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648. since the newly created donor splice site is likely to compete with the normal one, variations of the levels of normal and aberrant transcripts of the OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648 gene in the cochlea may explain the variability in the MESHD003638 presentation.. 
10802668	heterozygous loss of six5 in mice is sufficient to cause ocular MESHD002386. OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) is an OMIM178110MESHC566739 disorder characterized by skeletal DOID767, MESHD009222, OMIM115000MESHD001145, hyperinsulinaemia, DOID1059MESHD008607 and ocular MESHD002386. the genetic OMIM188560 in dm is a ctg repeat expansion located in the 3 untranslated region of dmpk and 5 of a homeodomain-encoding gene, six5 (formerly dmahp; refs 2-5). there are three mechanisms by which ctg expansion can result in dm. first, repeat expansion may alter the processing or transport of the mutant dmpk mrna and consequently reduce dmpk levels. second, ctg expansion may establish a region of heterochromatin 3 of the repeat sequence and decrease six5 transcription. third, toxic effects of the repeat expansion may be intrinsic to the repeated elements at the level of dna or rna (refs 10, 11). previous studies have demonstrated that a dose-dependent loss of dm15 (the mouse dmpk homologue) in mice produces a partial dm phenotype characterized by decreased development of skeletal muscle force and cardiac conduction disorders. to test the role of six5 loss in dm, we have analysed a MESHD013180 of mice in which six5 was deleted. our results demonstrate that the rate and severity of DOID83MESHD002386 formation is inversely related to six5 dosage and is temporally progressive. six5 +/- and six5-/- mice show increased steady-state levels of the na +/k + -atpase alpha-1 subunit and decreased dm15 mrna levels. thus, altered ion homeostasis within the lens may contribute to DOID83MESHD002386 formation. as ocular MESHD002386 are a characteristic feature of dm, these results demonstrate that decreased six5 transcription is important in the aetiology of dm. our data support the hypothesis that dm is a contiguous gene DOID225MESHD013577 associated with the partial loss of both dmpk and six5.. 
10484765	cis and trans effects of the OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) mutation in a cell culture model. the mutation causing OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) has been identified as a ctg expansion in the 3-untranslated region (3-utr) of the dm protein kinase gene (dmpk), but the mechanism (s) of pathogenesis remain unknown. studies using dm patient materials have often produced confusing results. therefore, to study the effects of the dm mutation in a controlled environment, we have established a cell culture model system using c2c12 mouse myoblasts. by expressing chimeric reporter constructs containing a reporter gene fused to a human dmpk 3-utr, we identified both cis and trans effects that are mediated by the dm mutation. our data show that a mutant dmpk 3-utr, with as few as 57 ctgs, had a negative cis effect on protein expression and resulted in the aggregation of reporter transcripts into discrete nuclear foci. we determined by deletion analysis that an expanded (ctg) (n) tract alone was sufficient to mediate these cis effects. furthermore, in contrast to the normal dmpk 3-utr mrna, a mutant dmpk 3-utr mrna with (cug) (200) selectively inhibited myogenic differentiation of c2c12 myoblasts. genetic analysis and the cre- loxp system were used to clearly demonstrate that the myoblast fusion OMIM188560 could be rescued by eliminating the expression of the mutant dmpk 3-utr transcript. characterization of spontaneous deletion events mapped the inhibitory effect to the (ctg) (n) expansion and/or the 3 end of the dmpk 3-utr. these results provide evidence that the dm mutation acts in cis to reduce protein production (consistent with dmpk haploinsufficiency) and in trans as a riboregulator to inhibit myogenesis.. 
8071955	intelligence quotient profile in OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223, intergenerational deficit, and correlation with ctg amplification. an abbreviated wechsler adult intelligence scale revised (wais-r) was used to assess verbal and arithmetical cognitive performance in 55 subjects with OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm), covering all grades of DOID4MESHD004194 severity, and 31 controls at 50% risk of inheriting dm. scaled scores from the assessment were converted into an intelligence quotient (iq) estimation on each person. significant iq differences were found between  (1) all 55 dm subjects (mean 90. 2, sd 16. 1) and 31 controls (102. 6, sd 9. 4), with no sex differences in either group; (2) 15 affected parents (99. 3, sd 12. 2) and their affected children (88. 1, sd 17. 2), where significance was dependent on parental sex being female; and (3) 15 pairs of affected sibs (89. 6, sd 13. 2) and their normal sibs (100. 2, sd 7. 6). iq steadily declined as (1) the age of onset of MESHD012816 decreased, and (2) the ctg expansion size increased. the correlation appeared to be more linear with age of onset. the correlation of iq difference and ctg expansion difference in both the dm parent-child pairs and normal sib-affected sib pairs was poor, indicating that ctg expansion is not a reliable predictor of iq either in individual persons or families. further analysis of cognitive function in dm is required to clarify specific deficits characteristic of this patient group 
1361318	complement factor 2 deficiency: a clinical and serological family study. inherited DOID626MESHD000081208 are associated with a variety of DOID65MESHD003240. a family with inherited deficiency of complement factor 2 (c2) is described in which two family members with homozygous OMIM217000DOID0060295 developed cutaneous DOID865MESHD014657 and OMIM270150DOID12894MESHD012859. the other family members had heterozygous OMIM217000DOID0060295 and each member had the hla-a25, b18, dr2 (w15) haplotype. the mother had seropositive OMIM180300DOID7148MESHD001172. further studies showed the presence of cryoglobulins, antibodies against endothelial cells, and anticardiolipin antibodies.. 
1352883	oncogenic point mutations in exon 20 of the OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 gene in families showing incomplete penetrance and mild expression of the OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 phenotype. the OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175-predisposition gene, OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175, segregates as an OMIM178110MESHC566739 trait with high (90%) penetrance. certain families, however, show an unusual low-penetrance phenotype with many individuals being unaffected, unilaterally affected, or with evidence of spontaneously regressed DOID162MESHD009369. we have used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and pcr sequencing to study two such families. mutations were found in exon 20 of OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 in both cases. in one family a c----t transition in codon 661 converts an arginine (cgg) to a tryptophan (tgg) codon. in this family, incomplete penetrance and mild phenotypic expression were observed in virtually all patients, possibly indicating that single amino acid changes may modify protein structure/function such that MESHD063646 is not inevitable. in the second family the mutation in codon 675 is a g----t transversion that converts a glutamine (gaa) to a stop (taa) codon. however, this mutation also occurs near a potential cryptic splice acceptor site, raising the possibility of alternative splicing resulting in a less severely disrupted protein.. 
10502833	identification of a novel r21x mutation in the liver-type arginase gene (arg1) in four portuguese patients with OMIM207800DOID9278MESHD020162. OMIM207800DOID9278MESHD020162 is a rare autossomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency in the cytosolic liver-type arginase enzyme (l-arginine urea-hydrolase; e. c. 3. 5. 3. 1). in order to investigate the molecular basis for OMIM207800DOID9278MESHD020162 in four unrelated portuguese patients (two from northern portugal and two from madeira island) we performed a dna sequence analysis of all the exons and exon/intron boundaries of the liver-type arginase gene (arg1). all patients were found to be homozygous for a newly identified c - > t transition in codon 21 (exon 2) substituting arginine for a premature stop codon (r21x  cga to tga) and generating a nlaiii restriction site. restriction digestion following pcr amplification of arg1 exon 2 confirmed the presence of the mutation.
10930571	a mutation in the pleckstrin homology (ph) domain of the OMIM202200MESHC565974 gene in an italian family with OMIM305400DOID0111824DOID6683MESHC535331 (OMIM305400DOID0111824DOID6683MESHC535331). OMIM305400DOID0111824DOID6683MESHC535331 (OMIM305400DOID6683MESHC535331) is an x-linked disorder characterised by short OMIM475000 and multiple facial, limb and genital abnormalities. a gene, OMIM202200MESHC565974, altered in a patient with OMIM305400DOID6683MESHC535331 phenotype, has been identified and found to encode a protein with homology to rho/rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors (rho/rac gef). however, since this original report on identification of a mutated OMIM202200MESHC565974 gene in an OMIM305400DOID6683MESHC535331 patient, no additional mutations in the OMIM202200MESHC565974 gene have been described. we analysed 13 independent patients with clinical diagnosis of OMIM305400DOID6683MESHC535331. one patient presented a mutation that results in a nucleotide change in exon 10 of the OMIM202200MESHC565974 gene (g2559 > a) substituting a gln for arg in position 610. the mutation was found to segregate with the OMIM305400DOID6683MESHC535331 phenotype in affected males and carrier females in the family of this patient. interestingly, arg-610 is located within one of the two pleckstrin homology (ph) domains of the OMIM202200MESHC565974 gene and it corresponds to a highly conserved residue which has been involved in insp binding in ph domains of other proteins. the same residue is often mutated in the brutons tyrosine kinase (btk) gene in patients with an x-linked DOID2583OMIM601495OMIM612692OMIM613500OMIM613501OMIM613502OMIM613506OMIM616941MESHD000361. the arg610gln mutation represents the first case of a mutation in the ph domain of the OMIM202200MESHC565974 gene and additional evidence that mutations in ph domains can be associated to human DOID4MESHD004194MESHC.. 
2055114	localization of histidase to human chromosome region 12q22----q24.1 and mouse chromosome region 10c2----d1. the human gene for histidase (histidine ammonia-lyase; hal), the enzyme deficient in OMIM235800DOID0060168MESHC538320, was assigned to human chromosome 12 by southern blot analysis of human x mouse somatic cell hybrid dna. the gene was sublocalized to region 12q22----q24. 1 by in situ hybridization, using a human histidase cdna. the homologous locus in the mouse (hal) was mapped to region 10c2----d1 by in situ hybridization, using a cell line from a mouse homozygous for a 1. 10 robertsonian translocation. these assignments extend the conserved syntenic region between human chromosome 12 and mouse chromosome 10 that includes the genes for phenylalanine hydroxylase, gamma interferon, peptidase, and citrate synthase. the localization of histidase to mouse chromosome 10 suggests that the histidase regulatory locus (OMIM143095DOID0050813) and the OMIM235800DOID0060168MESHC538320 mutation (his), which are both known to be on chromosome 10, may be alleles of the histidase structural gene locus.
10364521	noninvasive test for OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600, using hair root analysis. identification of the fmr1 gene and the repeat-amplification mechanism causing OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600 led to development of reliable dna-based diagnostic methods, including southern blot hybridization and pcr. both methods are performed on dna isolated from peripheral blood cells and measure the repeat size in fmr1. using an immunocytochemical technique on blood smears, we recently developed a novel test for identification of patients with OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600. this method, also called " antibody test, " uses monoclonal antibodies against the fmr1 gene product (fmrp) and is based on absence of fmrp in patients cells. here we describe a new diagnostic test to identify male patients with OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600, on the basis of lack of fmrp in their hair roots. expression of fmrp in hair roots was studied by use of an fmrp-specific antibody test, and the percentage of fmrp-expressing hair roots in controls and in male fragile x patients was determined. control individuals showed clear expression of fmrp in nearly every hair root, whereas male fragile x patients lacked expression of fmrp in almost all their hair roots. mentally retarded female patients with a full mutation showed fmrp expression in only some of their hair roots (< 55%), and no overlap with normal female controls was observed. the advantages of this test are (1) plucking of hair follicles does no appreciable harm to the mentally retarded patient, (2) hairs can be sent in a simple envelope to a diagnostic center, and (3) the result of the test is available within 5 h of plucking. in addition, this test enabled us to identify two fragile x patients who did not show the full mutation by analysis of dna isolated from blood cells.. 
1384324	pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194: detection of mutations thr181----pro and leu223----pro in the proteolipid protein gene, and prenatal diagnosis. a family with an apparent history of x-linked pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 presented for genetic counseling, requesting carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis. rflp analysis using the proteolipid protein (plp) gene probe was uninformative in this family. a prenatal diagnosis on a chorionic villus sample (OMIM122460OMIM500007MESHD003333) was carried out using single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of a variant in exon 4 of the plp gene. the fetus was predicted to be unaffected. sequencing of the exon from the OMIM122460OMIM500007MESHD003333, the predicted-carrier mother, and the obligate-carrier grandmother revealed an a-to-c change at nucleotide 541 in the two women but not in the fetus. as this change results in a thr-to-pro change at amino acid 181 in a region of the gene predicted to be part of a transmembrane segment, it was concluded that this was the mutation causing the DOID4MESHD004194 in this family. in addition, in a second family, an exon 5 variant band pattern on sscp analysis was shown by sequencing to be due to a t-to-c change at nucleotide 668. this results in a leu-to-pro change in a carrier mother and in her two affected sons. these results provide further examples of mutations in plp that cause pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 and illustrate the value of sscp in genetic analysis.. 
2404853	a normal male with an inherited deletion of one exon within the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene. we describe two brothers with identical inherited deletions of one single exon within the middle of the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene; one brother has becker DOID9884MESHD009136 diagnosed at 11 years of age, whereas the older brother is normal at 18. these results have implications for genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis in families with becker DOID9884MESHD009136.. 
10406661	small deletions in the type ii collagen triple OMIM617671 produce OMIM156550DOID0080045MESHC537207. OMIM156550DOID0080045MESHC537207 is a moderately severe type ii collagenopathy, characterized by short trunk and limbs, kyphoscoliosis, midface hypoplasia, severe DOID11830OMIM608367MESHD009216, and MESHD034381. mutations in the gene that encodes type ii collagen (col2a1), the predominant protein of cartilage, have been identified in a number of individuals with OMIM156550DOID0080045MESHC537207. all but two of these previously described mutations cause in-frame deletions in type ii collagen, either by small deletions in the gene or splice site alterations. furthermore, all but one of these mutations is located between exons 12 and 24 in the col2a1 gene. we used heteroduplex analysis to identify sequence anomalies in five individuals with OMIM156550DOID0080045MESHC537207. sequencing of the index patients genomic dna identified four new dominant mutations in col2a1 that result in OMIM156550DOID0080045MESHC537207  a 21-bp deletion in exon 16, an 18-bp deletion in exon 19, and 4-bp deletions in the splice donor sites of introns 14 and 20. a previously described 28-bp deletion at the col2a1 exon 12-intron 12 junction, deleting the splice donor site, was identified in the fifth case. the latter three mutations are predicted to result in exon skipping in the mrna encoded from the mutant allele. these data suggest that OMIM156550DOID0080045MESHC537207 results from shorter type ii collagen monomers, and support the hypothesis that alteration of a specific col2a1 domain, which may span from exons 12 to 24, leads to the OMIM156550DOID0080045MESHC537207 phenotype..

DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 and DOID1993 were subsequently diagnosed in the patient. she was profoundly mentally retarded, autistic, and had minor dysmorphic features consistent with those of previous patients with similar deletions. the deletion arose as a result of recombination within the small insertion loop formed at meiosis by the direct insertion (dir ins (5) (q22. 3q14. 2q15)) found in the patients mother. this family further confirms the cytogenetic mapping of both mcc and OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 genes to 5q22 and comparison with other recent cases suggests that both genes and their closely linked markers lie within the 5q22. 1 subband

3362213	identification of an altered splice site in ashkenazi OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661. OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 is an autosomal recessive DOID630MESHD030342 resulting from mutation of the hexa gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme, beta-n-acetylhexosaminidase a (ref. 1). a relatively high frequency of carriers (1/27) of a lethal, infantile form of the DOID4MESHD004194 is found in the ashkenazi jewish population, but it is not yet evident whether this has resulted from a founder effect and random genetic drift or from a selective advantage of heterozygotes. we have identified a single-base mutation in a cloned fragment of the hexa gene from an ashkenazi jewish patient. this change, the substitution of a c for g in the first nucleotide of intron 12 is expected to result in defective splicing of the messenger rna. a test for the mutant allele based on amplification of dna by the polymerase chain rection and cleavage of a ddei restriction site generated by the mutation revealed that this case and two other cases of the ashkenazi, infantile form of OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 are heterozygous for two different mutations. the occurrence of multiple mutant alleles warrants further examination of the selective advantage hypothesis.. 
10484772	DOID7765 of the retina (unilateral retinal DOID1272MESHD013684) caused by somatic mutation in the ndp gene: a role for norrin in retinal angiogenesis. coats DOID4MESHD004194 is characterized by abnormal retinal vascular development (so-called retinal DOID1272MESHD013684) which results in massive intraretinal and subretinal lipid accumulation (exudative OMIM180050DOID5327MESHD012163). the classical form of coats DOID4MESHD004194 is almost invariably isolated, unilateral and seen in males. a female with a unilateral variant of coats DOID4MESHD004194 gave birth to a son affected by OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849. both carried a missense mutation within the ndp gene on chromosome xp11. 2 2. subsequently analysis of the retinas of nine enucleated eyes from males with coats DOID4MESHD004194 demonstrated in one a somatic mutation in the ndp gene which was not present within non-retinal tissue. we suggest that coats DOID1272MESHD013684 is secondary to somatic mutation in the ndp gene which results in a deficiency of norrin (the protein product of the ndp gene) within the developing retina. this supports recent observations that the protein is critical for normal retinal vasculogenesis. 
1357962	MESHD014314 15 with loss of the paternal 15 as a cause of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 due to maternal disomy. MESHD024182 has recently been recognized to cause human disorders, including OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218). we describe a particularly instructive case which raises important issues concerning the mechanisms producing MESHD024182 and whose evaluation provides evidence that MESHD014314 may precede MESHD024182 in a fetus. chorionic villus sampling performed for advanced maternal age revealed MESHD014314 15 in all direct and cultured cells, though the fetus appeared normal. chromosome analysis of amniocytes obtained at 15 wk was normal in over 100 cells studied. the child was hypotonic at birth, and high-resolution banding failed to reveal the deletion of 15q11-13, a deletion which is found in 50% -70% of patients with OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. over time, typical features of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 developed. molecular genetic analysis using probes for chromosome 15 revealed maternal disomy. maternal OMIM158250 with fertilization of a disomic egg by a normal sperm, followed by loss of the paternal 15, is a likely cause of confined placental mosaicism and MESHD024182 in this case of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218, and advanced maternal age may be a predisposing factor.. 
492335	genetic OMIM188560 in secretion of complement c5 in mice. a genetic deficiency of the fifth (c5) component of complement1-3, a serum glycoprotein of molecular weight (mw) 220, 000 (ref. 4), has been found in 39% of inbred MESHD013180 of mice3. sera of deficient mice lack detectable c5 activity and protein2, 3. in addition deficient mice produce antibody to mouse c5 when injected with sera from c5 sufficient (normal) MESHD013180. levy et al. 5 showed that somatic cell hybrids between c5 deficient (b10. d2/old line) macrophages and either c5 sufficient (b10. d2/new line) mouse kidney or chicken erythroblasts secreted haemolytically active mouse c5 in vitro. several possible molecular mechanisms to account for the findings were considered, but insufficient direct data were available to choose among them. we recently reported that mouse (cd. 1 MESHD013180) peritoneal cells in culture synthesise and secrete a single chain precursor, pro-c5 (mw approximately 210, 000), of the two-chain (alpha chain, 125, 000 and beta chain 83, 000 mw) c5 protein6. radiolabelled precursor c5 was contained within the cells and was secreted into the tissue culture media. using similar methods, we now find that OMIM609536DOID8158MESHC537005 in each of five different mouse MESHD013180 (akr, swr, OMIM105650DOID1339MESHD029503/2j8 a/hej and b10. d2/old line) is due to a failure in secretion of c5 protein and not to a failure in biosynthesis of pro-c5 
8528199	wasp gene mutations in OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 and x-linked DOID1588MESHD013921. the wasp gene has been recently cloned from xp11. 23 and shown to be mutated in three patients with the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 (was). we have developed a screening protocol for identifying wasp gene alterations in genomic dna and have identified a spectrum of novel mutations in 12 additional unrelated families. these missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations involve eight of the 12 exons of the gene. two mutations creating premature termination codons were associated with lack of detectable mrna on northern blots. four amino acid substitutions, leu27phe, thr48ile, val75met and arg477lys, were found in patients with congenital DOID1588MESHD013921 and no clinically evident immune OMIM188560 indicating that the wasp gene is the site for mutations in x-linked DOID1588MESHD013921 as well as in was. a t-cell line from a was patient contained two independent dna alterations, a constitutional frameshift mutation, also present in peripheral blood leukocytes from the patient, and compensatory splice site mutation unique to the cell line. the distribution of eight missense mutations provides valuable information on amino acids which are essential for normal protein function, and suggests that sites in the first two exons are hot-spots for mutation. 
1307253	detection of a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene by multiple sscp. a combination of multiplex pcr with the single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) technique was employed to screen for point mutations in the human dystrophin gene. co-amplification of 11 exons from genomic dna of duchenne and becker DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388/OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826) patients with no deletion or duplication was performed and the samples subjected to multiple sscp analysis. we report the case of a nonsense mutation in a duchenne patient identified by this approach. the mutation introduces a termination codon within exon 8 of the dystrophin gene. it is predicted to cause a very premature translational termination accounting for the severe phenotype observed. the patient inherited this mutation from his mother. in addition the analysis revealed 5 polymorphisms useful for internal control.. 
8346255	molecular mechanisms of oncogenic mutations in DOID162MESHD009369 from patients with bilateral and DOID4651. the OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 gene from 12 human OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 DOID162MESHD009369 has been analyzed exon-by-exon with the single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. mutations were found in all DOID162MESHD009369, and one-third of the DOID162MESHD009369 had independent mutations in both alleles neither of which were found in the germ line, confirming their true sporadic nature. in the remaining two-thirds of the DOID162MESHD009369 only one mutation was found, consistent with the loss-of-heterozygosity theory of MESHD063646. point mutations, the majority of which were c-- > t transitions, were the most common abnormality and usually resulted in the conversion of an arginine codon to a stop codon. small deletions were the second most common abnormality and most often created a downstream stop codon as the result of a reading frameshift. deletions and point mutations also affected splice junctions. direct repeats were present at the breakpoint junctions in the majority of deletions, supporting a slipped-mispairing mechanism. point mutations generally produced dna sequences which resulted in perfect homology with endogenous sequences which lay within 14 bp..

409732	hereditary OMIM610102MESHC566443. diagnosis and hla studies in a french-canadian family. the serum of a 44-yr-old woman of french-canadian descent having a b-27 positive ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166 was deficient in the seventh component of complement (c7) as determined by hemolytic and immunochemical methods. no inhibitor against c7 was detected, and the levels of all other complement components were normal. no deficiency in the opsonic activity of the serum was found, and the results of basic coagulation studies of the plasma were normal. on investigation of the patients family, two sisters were found to have the same deficiency but were otherwise in good health. the seven other siblings were heterozygous for OMIM610102MESHC566443, while the paternal aunt had a normal c7 level. in the third generation, six children of the three homozygous sisters and five children of heterozygotes were available for testing. studies of the hla antigens in all the 22 subjects and in three spouses indicated no close linkage between the cm deficienty and the hla system. in addition, the simultaneous occurrence of two hereditary DOID626MESHD000081208 (c2 and c7) was discovered in one family of this remarkable kindred.. 
10598815	OMIM203800DOID0050473MESHD056769: further evidence for linkage to human chromosome 2p13. OMIM203800DOID0050473MESHD056769 is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by DOID8466MESHD012162, DOID10003MESHD006319, early-onset OMIM601665OMIM618406DOID9970MESHD009765, and non-insulin-dependent DOID9351MESHD003920. the gene for OMIM203800DOID0050473MESHD056769 (alms1) has been previously localized to human chromosome 2p13 by homozygosity mapping in two distinct isolated populations - french acadian and north african. pair-wise analyses resulted in maximum lod (logarithm of the odds ratio) scores of 3. 84 and 2. 9, respectively. to confirm these findings, a large linkage study was performed in twelve additional families segregating for OMIM203800DOID0050473MESHD056769. a maximum two-point lod score of 7. 13 (theta = 0. 00) for marker d2s2110 and a maximum cumulative multipoint lod score of 9. 16 for marker d2s2110 were observed, further supporting linkage to chromosome 2p13. no evidence of genetic heterogeneity was observed in these families. meiotic recombination events have localized the critical region containing alms1 to a 6. 1-cm interval flanked by markers d2s327 and d2s286. a fine resolution radiation hybrid map of 31 genes and markers has been constructed.
2575071	haplotype and multipoint linkage analysis in finnish OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794 families. multipoint linkage analysis of OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794 (OMIM303100) and seven x chromosomal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflps) was carried out in 18 finnish OMIM303100 families. the data place OMIM303100 distal to pgk and dxs72, very close to dxys1 and dxys5 (zmax = 24 at theta = 0) and proximal to dxys4 and dxys12. this agrees with the data obtained from other linkage studies and from physical mapping. all the OMIM303100 males and carrier females studied have the same dxys1 allele in coupling with OMIM303100. in northeastern finland, 66/69 chromosomes carrying OMIM303100 had the same haplotype at loci dxs72, dxys1, dxys4, and dxys12. the same haplotype is seen in only 15/99 chromosomes not carrying OMIM303100. moreover, in 71/104 non-OMIM303100 chromosomes, the haplotype at six marker loci is different from those seen in any of the 76 OMIM303100 chromosomes. this supports the previously described hypothesis that the large northern finnish OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794 pedigrees, comprising a total of over 80 living patients representing more than a fifth of all OMIM303100 patients described worldwide, carry the same mutation. these linkage and haplotype data provide improved opportunities for prenatal diagnosis based on rflp studies.. 
2253938	genetic heterogeneity at the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase locus in southern italy: a study on a population from the matera district. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) has been analyzed by gel electrophoresis and by quantitative assay in an unselected sample of 1524 schoolboys from the province of matera (lucania) in southern italy. we have identified 43 subjects with a g6pd variant. of these, 31 had severe DOID2862MESHD005955, nine had mild to moderate deficiency, and three had a non-deficient electrophoretic variant. the overall rate of DOID2862MESHD005955 was 2. 6%. the frequency of DOID2862MESHD005955, ranging from 7. 2% on the ionian coast to zero on the eastern side of the lucanian apennines, appears to be inversely related to the distance of each town examined from the ionian coast, suggesting that this geographic distribution may reflect, at least in part, gene flow from greek settlers. biochemical characterization has shown that most of the DOID2862MESHD005955 in this population is accounted for by g6pd mediterranean. in addition, we have found several examples of two other known polymorphic variants (g6pd cagliari and g6pd a-); three new polymorphic variants, g6pd metaponto (class iii), g6pd montalbano (class iii), and g6pd pisticci (class iv); and two sporadic variants, g6pd tursi (class iii) and g6pd ferrandina (class ii). these data provide further evidence for the marked genetic heterogeneity of DOID2862MESHD005955 within a relatively narrow geographic area and they prove the presence in the italian peninsula of a gene (gda-) regarded as characteristically african.
10411929	defective ctla-4 cycling pathway in OMIM214500DOID2935MESHD002609: a possible mechanism for deregulation of t lymphocyte activation. cytotoxic t lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (ctla-4, also known as cd152) has been shown to play a major role in the regulation of t cell activation. its membrane expression is highly regulated by endocytosis and trafficking through the secretory lysosome pathway. OMIM214500DOID2935MESHD002609 (OMIM214500DOID2935MESHD002609) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene, lyst. it results in defective membrane targeting of the proteins present in secretory lysosomes, and it is associated with a variety of features, including a lymphoproliferative DOID225MESHD013577 with hemophagocytosis. the murine equivalent of OMIM214500DOID2935MESHD002609, beige mice, present similar characteristics but do not develop the lymphoproliferative DOID225MESHD013577. we show herein that ctla-4 is present in enlarged, abnormal vesicles in OMIM214500DOID2935MESHD002609 t cells and is not properly expressed at the cell surface after t cell activation, whereas its surface expression is not impaired. it is therefore proposed that the defective surface expression of ctla-4 by OMIM214500DOID2935MESHD002609 t cells is involved in the generation of lymphoproliferative DOID4MESHD004194. this observation may provide insight into the role of ctla-4 in humans.. 
10398436	beta-catenin accumulation and mutation of the ctnnb1 gene in DOID687MESHD018197. DOID687MESHD018197 is a rare DOID162 of the liver that occurs in children at an average age of 2 to 3 years. epidemiologic studies have shown an increased frequency of this DOID162MESHD009369 type in families affected by DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125. in addition to the epidemiologic data, molecular genetic studies suggest that inactivation of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor may be involved in DOID687MESHD018197 MESHD063646. a major function of OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 is the downregulation of beta-catenin, a transcription-activating protein with oncogenic potential. in an ongoing immunohistochemical study of beta-catenin expression in sporadic cases of DOID162MESHD009369 types that are associated with DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125, we observed increased beta-catenin levels in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei of three investigated DOID687MESHD018197. sequencing of exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene (ctnnb1) revealed an activating mutation in one of the DOID162MESHD009369 samples. our data indicate for the first time that beta-catenin accumulation may play a role in the development of DOID687MESHD018197 and that activating mutations of the beta-catenin gene may substitute biallelic OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 inactivation in this DOID162MESHD009369 type. genes chromosomes DOID162MESHD009369 25  399-402, 1999.. 
1833974	sequence of dna flanking the exons of the hexa gene, and identification of mutations in OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661. the rapid identification of mutations causing OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 requires the capacity to readily screen the regions of the hexa gene most likely to be affected by mutation. we have sequenced the portions of the introns flanking each of the 14 hexa exons in order to specify oligonucleotide primers for the pcr-dependent amplification of each exon and splice-junction sequence. the amplified products were analyzed, by electrophoresis in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, for the presence of either heteroduplexes, derived from the annealing of normal and mutant dna strands, or single-strand conformational polymorphisms (sscp), derived from the renaturation of single-stranded dna. five novel mutations from OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 patients were detected  a 5-bp deletion of tctcc in ivs-9; a 2-bp deletion of tg in exon 5; g78 to a, giving a stop codon in exon 1; g533 to t in exon 5, producing the third amino acid substitution detected at this site; and g to c at position 1 of ivs-2, expected to produce abnormal splicing. in addition, two mutations, (g1496 to a in exon 13 and a 4-bp insertion in exon 11) that have previously been reported were identified.. 
10742101	in vivo modulation of hmgic reduces OMIM601665OMIM618406DOID9970MESHD009765. the hmgi family of proteins consists of three members, hmgic, hmgi and hmgi (y), that function as architectural factors and are essential components of the enhancesome. hmgic is predominantly expressed in proliferating, undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and is not detected in adult tissues. it is disrupted and misexpressed in a number of mesenchymal tumour cell types, including fat-cell tumours (DOID10192DOID3315MESHD008067). in addition hmgic-/- mice have a deficiency in fat tissue. to study its role in adipogenesis and OMIM601665OMIM618406DOID9970MESHD009765, we examined hmgic expression in the adipose tissue of adult, obese mice. mice with a partial or complete deficiency of hmgic resisted diet-induced OMIM601665OMIM618406DOID9970MESHD009765. disruption of hmgic caused a reduction in the OMIM601665OMIM618406DOID9970MESHD009765 induced by leptin deficiency (lepob/lepob) in a gene-dose-dependent manner. our studies implicate a role for hmgic in fat-cell proliferation, indicating that it may be an adipose-specific target for the treatment of OMIM601665OMIM618406DOID9970MESHD009765.. 
10210128	prenatal diagnosis by fish in a family with pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 caused by duplication of plp gene. a diagnosis of pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 (mim 312080) was made in a young boy. no mutation in the coding region of the proteolipid protein (plp) gene had been found. the boys maternal aunt came for prenatal diagnosis when 16 + weeks pregnant and carrying a male fetus. samples were tested for duplication of the plp gene, by interphase fish, in lymphocyte preparations from the proband, his aunt and an amniotic fluid cell preparation from the fetus. the proband was found to carry the duplication, thus confirming the diagnosis of DOID3210OMIM169500OMIM312080MESHD020371, but neither the aunt nor the fetus carried a duplication.. 
1056013	somatic rearrangement of chromosome 14 in human lymphocytes. MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 is a rare DOID630MESHD030342 associated with immune deficiency, MESHD043171, and a predisposition to lymphoid DOID162MESHD009369. we have detected chromosomally anomalous clones of lymphocytes in eight patients with this disorder. chromosome banding disclosed that the clones are consistently marked by structural rearrangement of the long arm (q) of chromosome 14. a translocation involving 14q was found in clones obtained from seven of the eight patients whereas a MESHC535487 chromosome was found in a clone obtained from the other. these findings as well as data obtained by others for patients with MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 suggest that structural rearrangement of 14q is the initial chromosomal change in lymphocyte clones of patients with this disorder. chromosomes of lymphocytes from one of the patients were studied before and after the onset of chronic DOID1037MESHD007945. before DOID1240MESHD007938 was diagnosed, the patient had a lymphocyte clone with a 14q translocation. this clone appears to have given rise to the leukemic cells. we hypothesize that structural rearrangement of 14q is directly related to abnormal growth of lymphocytes and that it may be a step toward the development of lymphoid DOID162MESHD009369. increasing evidence, provided by others, for the nonrandom involvement of 14q in african-type DOID8584OMIM113970MESHD002051 and other lymphoid DOID162MESHD009369 further strengthens this hypothesis.. 
1301200	two missense mutations causing mild hyperphenylalaninemia associated with dna haplotype 12. the genetic defects responsible for most OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 (OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661) and hyperphenylalaninemia (hpa) cases are located in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600) gene. approximately 50-60 mutations have been reported in caucasians and are reflected in a wide range of clinical severities. most mutations are linked to specific haplotypes, as defined by eight polymorphic restriction sites in the OMIM178600 gene. we hypothesized that there is at least one mild mutation linked to haplotype 12 in the swedish OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661/hpa population, since 7 of 8 patients carrying haplotype 12 had mild hpa. sequence analysis revealed a c-to-g transversion at the second base of codon 322, resulting in a substitution of glycine for alanine, in four mutant haplotype 12 genes, and a g-to-a transition at the second base of codon 408, resulting in a substitution of glutamine for arginine, in another three mutant haplotype 12 genes. these mutations segregated with mutant haplotype 12 alleles in nuclear families but were not present on normal or other mutant alleles. both mutations were tested in a eukaryotic expression system in which enzyme activities of different mutant OMIM178600 enzymes reflect the relative severities of the mutations, although these in vitro activities cannot be translated directly into in vivo hepatic activities. the a322g mutant OMIM178600 had about 75% and the r408q mutant OMIM178600 about 55% of the wild-type OMIM178600 enzyme activity. these in vitro activities are the highest reported for mutant OMIM178600 enzymes produced in the same expression system.

7959759	genomic organization of the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 gene. OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326), the most frequent DOID906MESHD018901, is a severe DOID1289MESHD019636 associated with an impairment of very long chain fatty acids beta-oxidation. we have recently identified by positional cloning the gene responsible for OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326, located in xq28. it encodes a new member of the " abc " superfamily of membrane-associated transporters that shows, in particular, significant homology to the 70-kda peroxisomal membrane protein (pmp70). we report here a detailed characterization of the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 gene structure. it extends over 21 kb and consists of 10 exons. to facilitate the detection of mutations in OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 patients, we have determined the intronic sequences flanking the exons as well as the sequence of the 3 untranslated region and of the immediate 5 promoter region. sequences present in distal exons cross-hybridize strongly to additional sequences in the human genome. the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 gene has been positioned on a pulsed-field map between dxs15 and the l1cam gene, about 650 kb upstream from the color pigment genes. the frequent occurrence of color vision anomalies observed in patients with OMIM300100MESHD000326 (the adult onset form of OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326) thus does not represent a contiguous gene DOID225MESHD013577 but a secondary manifestation of OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326.. 
10220405	brca1 interacts with components of the histone deacetylase complex. germ-line mutations in the brca1 DOID162MESHD009369-suppressor gene are associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. brca1 contains a carboxyl-terminal domain (brct) that is shared with several other proteins involved in maintaining genome integrity. in an effort to understand the function of brca1, we sought to isolate proteins that interact with the brct domain. purified brct polypeptide was used as a probe to screen a human placenta cdna expression library by far western analysis. here we report that brca1 interacts in vivo and in vitro with the rb-binding proteins, rbap46 and rbap48, as well as with rb. moreover, the brct domain associates with the histone deacetylases hdac1 and hdac2. these results demonstrate that brca1 interacts with components of the histone deacetylase complex, and therefore may explain the involvement of brca1 in multiple processes such as transcription, dna repair, and recombination.. 
1279971	deletion of the kit and pdgfra genes in a patient with OMIM172800DOID3263MESHD016116. we have previously shown that human OMIM172800DOID3263MESHD016116 results from mutations of the kit gene, which encodes the receptor for the mast/stem cell growth factor and is located in chromosome segment 4q12. using dna of a patient with OMIM172800DOID3263MESHD016116, DOID1059MESHD008607, and multiple congenital anomalies associated with a 46, xy, del (4) (q12q21. 1) karyotype, we carried out quantitative southern blot hybridization analyses of the kit gene and the adjacent pdgfra (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha subunit) genes. the patient was hemizygous for both the kit and pdgfra genes, indicating that both of these genes are OMIM612069MESHC567429OMIM606217MESHC565249OMIM115197MESHC566169DOID0110552OMIM606346DOID0110494OMIM609006OMIM300123MESHC567485DOID0111806OMIM610125MESHC566441DOID0110927OMIM161800OMIM611590MESHC566910OMIM613750MESHC563526 within the deleted region. therefore, deletion of the kit and pdgfra genes may account for the piebald phenotype in this patient. 
3198117	glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants and their frequency in guangdong, china. erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) was characterized in blood samples obtained from 97 randomly selected males with enzyme deficiency from various regions of guangdong province, china. nine new variants (gd kaiping, gd boluo, gd huiyang, gd gaomin, gd qing-baijiang, gd gaozhou, gd huazhou, gd nanhai, and gd guangzhou) were identified. of the 31 variants found in this province, gd kaiping, gd taiwan-hakka, gd haad yai, gd haad yai-like and gd huiyang occurred most frequently. the frequency of each variant was calculated. the results demonstrated that the genetic heterogeneity of DOID2862MESHD005955 was high in this area.. 
10369860	a common molecular basis for rearrangement disorders on chromosome 22q11. the chromosome 22q11 region is susceptible to rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders and malignant DOID162MESHD009369. three congenital anomaly disorders, cat-eye DOID225MESHD013577, der () DOID225MESHD013577 and DOID11198DOID12583OMIM188400OMIM192430MESHD004062/OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062 (OMIM192430DOID11198DOID12583OMIM188400MESHD004062/OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062) are associated with MESHD058670, MESHD014314 or MESHD009006, respectively, for part of chromosome 22q11. OMIM192430DOID11198DOID12583OMIM188400MESHD004062/OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062 is the most common DOID225MESHD013577 associated with 22q11 rearrangements. in order to determine whether there are particular regions on 22q11 that are prone to rearrangements, the deletion end-points in a large number of OMIM192430DOID11198DOID12583OMIM188400MESHD004062/OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062 patients were defined by haplotype analysis. most OMIM192430DOID11198DOID12583OMIM188400MESHD004062/OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062 patients have a similar 3 mb deletion, some have a nested distal deletion breakpoint resulting in a 1. 5 mb deletion and a few rare patients have unique deletions or translocations. the high prevalence of the disorder in the population and the fact that most cases occur sporadically suggest that sequences at or near the breakpoints confer susceptibility to chromosome rearrangements. to investigate this hypothesis, we developed hamster-human somatic hybrid cell lines from OMIM192430DOID11198DOID12583OMIM188400MESHD004062/OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062 patients with all three classes of deletions and we now show that the breakpoints occur within similar low copy repeats, termed lcr22s. to support this idea further, we identified a family that carries an interstitial duplication of the same 3 mb region that is deleted in OMIM192430DOID11198DOID12583OMIM188400MESHD004062/OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062 patients. we present models to explain how the lcr22s can mediate different homologous recombination events, thereby generating a number of rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders. we identified five additional copies of the lcr22 on 22q11 that may mediate other rearrangements leading to DOID4MESHD004194. 
1424237	typical and partial OMIM115470MESHC535918: identification of the marker chromosome by fish. three children are reported with typical OMIM115470MESHC535918 (OMIM115470MESHC535918) and three more children with partial OMIM115470MESHC535918 because of absence of DOID12270OMIM120200OMIM216820MESHD003103, in which the supernumerary marker chromosome was studied by fish. using a genomic library, and also a centromeric and particularly a cosmid probe of 22q11, partial MESHD058670 was shown in all cases.. 
1313112	an intrachromosomal insertion causing 5q22 deletion and familial DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 in two generations. we report familial DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (fapc) with OMIM131600MESHD004814, osteomata, and areas of congenital MESHD006984 of the retinal pigment epithelium (chrpes) in a male patient and his maternal aunt, both of whom suffered a mild to moderate degree of mental handicap. both had an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (del (5) (q22q23. 2)). two other normal family members had the underlying direct insertion of chromosome 5 (dir ins (5) (q31. 3q22q23 3q22q23. 2)). molecular genetic and fluorescent hybridisation studies have shown that loci d5s37 and d5s98 are outside the deletion whereas loci detected by probes ef5. 44 and yn5. 48 are lost. as expected, the molecular analyses indicate loss of one allele at the mcc and OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 loci. the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene is located within band 5q22. familial direct insertions should be considered as a cause of recurrent microdeletion DOID225MESHD013577.
1303170	cloning of the OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 region in yeast artificial chromosomes. the gene responsible for OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 has been localized to a 2. 5 million base pair (mb) region between the loci d4s10 and d4s168 on the short arm of chromosome 4. as part of a strategy to clone the hd gene on the basis of its chromosomal location, we isolated genomic dna from the hd region as a set of overlapping yeast artificial chromosome (yac) clones. twenty-eight yac clones were identified by screening human yac libraries with twelve pcr-based sequence-tagged sites (stss) from the region. we assembled the yac clones into overlapping sets by hybridizing them to a large number of dna probes from the hd region, including the stss. in addition, we isolated the ends of the human dna inserts of most of the yac clones to assist in the construction of the contig. although almost half of the yacs appear to contain chimeric inserts and several contain internal deletions or other rearrangements, we were able to obtain over 2. 2 mb of the hd region in yacs, including one continuous segment of 2. 0 mb covering the region that most likely contains the hd gene. ten of the twenty eight yac clones comprise a minimal set spanning the 2. 2 mb. these clones provide reagents for the complete characterization of this region of the genome and for the eventual isolation of the hd gene. 
8113388	three novel mutations in five unrelated subjects with hereditary DOID2451MESHD018455 type i. a panel of eight unrelated subjects with inherited type i DOID2451MESHD018455 was screened for mutations in the pros1 gene. in five subjects an abnormality was found but mutations were not detected in the remaining three subjects. two subjects shared a g-- > a transition at position + 5 of the donor splice site consensus sequence of intron 10. also in two subjects an a-- > t transversion was detected in the stopcodon of the pros1 gene; this transversion predicts a protein s molecule that is extended by 14 amino acids. the fifth subject was found to possess two sequence abnormalities. one allele carried a g-- > a transition near the donor splice junction of intron 2, but this abnormality is probably neutral, since it was inherited from the parent with normal protein s antigen levels. in the other allele a single t insertion in codon -25 was found. analysis of platelet rna showed that only the mrna with the a-- > t mutation in the stopcodon is present in amounts comparable to wildtype rna. mrna from the alleles with the other two mutations was either undetectable or present in greatly reduced amounts. the latter indicates that a mrna based approach is not feasible for the genetic analysis of DOID2451MESHD018455 type i.. 
3029599	a potential animal model for OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926 through introduction of hprt mutations into mice. the human OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926 is a rare neurological and behavioural disorder, affecting only males, which is caused by an inherited deficiency in the level of activity of the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanosine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt). how the resulting alterations in purine metabolism lead to the severe symptoms characteristic of lesch-nyhan patients is still not understood. no mutations at the hprt locus leading to loss of activity have been described in laboratory animals. to derive an animal model for the OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926, we have used cultured mouse embryonic stem cells, mutagenized by retroviral insertion and selected for loss of hprt activity, to construct chimaeric mice. two clonal lines carrying different mutant hprt alleles have given rise to germ cells in chimaeras, allowing the derivation of MESHD013180 of mutant mice having the same biochemical OMIM188560 as lesch-nyhan patients. male mice carrying the mutant alleles are viable and analysis of their cells shows a total lack of hprt activity.. 
2316519	duplicational mutation at the duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 locus: its frequency, distribution, origin, and phenotypegenotype correlation. partial gene deletion is the major cause of mutation leading to duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) and becker DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826). partial gene duplication has also been recognized in a few cases. we have conducted a survey for duplication in 72 unrelated nondeletion patients, analyzed by southern blot hybridization with clones representing the entire OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 cdna. with careful quantitative analysis of hybridization band intensity, 10 cases were found to carry a duplication of part of the gene, a frequency of 14% for nondeletion cases (10/72), or 6% for all cases (10/181). the extent of these duplications has been characterized according to the published exon-containing hindiii fragment map, and in six of the 10 duplications a novel restriction fragment that spanned the duplication junction was detected. the resulting translational reading frame of mrna has been predicted for nine duplications. a shift of the reading frame was predicted in four of the six OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 cases and in one of the two intermediate cases, while the reading frame remained uninterrupted in both OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826 cases. rflp and quantitative southern blot analyses revealed a grandpaternal origin of duplication in four families and grandmaternal origin in one family. in all five families, the duplication was found to originate from a single x chromosome. unequal sister-chromatid exchange is proposed to be the mechanism for the formation of these duplications.. 
6087154	molecular evidence for new mutation at the hprt locus in lesch-nyhan patients. hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt; ec2. 4. 2. 8), which functions in the metabolic salvage of purines, is encoded by an x-linked gene in man. partial hprt deficiencies are associated with DOID13189MESHD015210, while absence of activity results in OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926 (l-n). l-n patients fail to reproduce and the heterozygous state appears to confer no selective advantage. thus, haldanes principle predicts that new mutations at the hprt locus must occur frequently in order for l-OMIM310465DOID0050769MESHC536108 to be maintained in the population. this constant introduction of new mutations would be expected to result in a heterogeneous collection of genetic lesions, some of which may be novel. as we report here, the mutations in the hprt gene of seven l-n patients, selected from an initial survey of 28 patients, have been characterized and all were found to be distinctly different, as predicted. the origin of one unusual mutation has been identified by analysis of dna from four generations of family members. further molecular analysis of the origin of new mutations at the hprt locus should aid in resolving the issue of an apparent difference in the frequency of hprt mutations in males and females 
3600793	the mapping of a cdna from the human x-linked duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 gene to the mouse x chromosome. the recent discovery of sequences at the site of the duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) gene in humans has opened up the possibility of a detailed molecular analysis of the genes in humans and in related mammalian species. until relatively recently, there was no obvious mouse model of this DOID630MESHD030342 for the development of therapeutic strategies. the identification of a mouse x-linked mutant showing DOID9884MESHD009136, OMIM309200MESHC564108, has provided a candidate mouse genetic homologue to the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 locus; the relatively mild pathological features of OMIM309200MESHC564108 suggest it may have more in common with mutations of the becker DOID9884MESHD009136 type at the same human locus, however. but the close genetic linkage of OMIM309200MESHC564108 to g6pd and hprt on the mouse x chromosome, coupled with its comparatively mild pathology, have suggested that the OMIM309200MESHC564108 mutation may instead correspond to emery dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136 which itself is closely linked to dna markers at xq28-qter in the region of g6pd on the human x chromosome. using an interspecific mouse domesticus/spretus cross, segregating for a variety of markers on the mouse x chromosome, we have positioned on the mouse x chromosome sequences homologous to a OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 cdna clone. these sequences map provocatively close to the OMIM309200MESHC564108 mutation and unexpectedly distant from sparse fur, spf, the mouse homologue of otc (ornithine transcarbamylase) which is closely linked to OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 on the human x chromosome.. 
10094559	identification of the mutation in the OMIM203500DOID9270MESHD000474 mouse model. OMIM203500DOID9270MESHD000474 (OMIM203500MESHD000474), an inborn error of metabolism caused by the loss of homogentisate 1, 2-dioxygenase (hgd), has been described in a mouse model created by ethylnitrosourea mutagenesis but the mutation in these mice has not previously been identified. we used rt-pcr to amplify the hgd cdna from hgd (OMIM203500MESHD000474)/hgd (OMIM203500MESHD000474) mice. two products shorter than the wild-type product were amplified. restriction mapping and dna sequencing were then used to identify the hgd (OMIM203500MESHD000474) mouse mutation, found to be a single base change in a splice donor consensus sequence, causing exon skipping and frame-shifted products. this base change allowed us to create a non-radioactive genotyping assay for this allele. 
1347968	common sequence motifs at the rearrangement sites of a constitutional x/autosome translocation and associated deletion. reciprocal chromosome translocations are common de novo rearrangements that occur randomly throughout the human genome. to learn about causative mechanisms, we have cloned and sequenced the breakpoints of a cytologically balanced constitutional reciprocal translocation, t (x; 4) (p21. 2; q31. 22), present in a girl with duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388). physical mapping of the derivative chromosomes, after their separation in somatic cell hybrids, reveals that the translocation disrupts the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene in xp21 within the 18-kb intron 16. restriction mapping and sequencing of clones that span both translocation breakpoints as well as the corresponding normal regions indicate the loss of approximately 5 kb in the formation of the derivative x chromosome, with 4-6 bp deleted from chromosome 4. rflp and southern analyses indicate that the de novo translocation is a paternal origin and that the fathers x chromosome contains the dna that is deleted in the derivative x. most likely, deletion and translation arose simultaneously from a complex rearrangement event that involves three chromosomal breakpoints. short regions of sequence homology were present at the three sites. a 5-bp sequence, ggaat, found exactly at the translocation breakpoints on both normal chromosomes x and 4, has been preserved only on the der (4) chromosome. it is likely that the x-derived sequence ggaatca has been lost in the formation of the der (x) chromosome, as it matches an inverted gaatca sequence present on the opposite strand exactly at the other end of the deleted 5-kb fragment. 
10874302	the human factor ix gene as germline mutagen test: samples from mainland china have the putatively endogenous pattern of mutation. germline mutations are the major source of genetic variation that allows a species to evolve over time but at the cost of mendelian DOID4MESHD004194 and MESHD020022 to multifactorial DOID4MESHD004194MESHC. previous analyses have revealed that the pattern of germline mutations in the factor ix gene (f9) is similar among a variety of ethnically and geographically diverse populations and compatible with the ancient pattern that has shaped the mammalian genome. here, we compare the pattern of germline mutation in a population of OMIM306900DOID12259MESHD002836 patients from mainland china (n = 66) to that in u. s. caucasians, blacks, and mexican hispanics and stratify by DOID4MESHD004194 severity and ethnicity. the similar pattern of germline mutation in all ethnic groups studied to date provides additional data compatible with the inference that endogenous processes predominate in germline mutations. 
3591825	phenotype heterogeneity among hemizygotes in a family biochemically screened for OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326. we report on two clinically, neurologically normal relatives of a boy affected by OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326); they were found repeatedly to have the biochemical OMIM188560 of an OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 hemizygote. the assay consisted in the determination of very-long-chain fatty acids in lyophilized and reconstituted plasma. while no evidence of neurologic DOID4MESHD004194 (DOID10579 or myeloneuropathy) was present in these hemizygotes, adrenocortical insufficiency provoking compensatory high acth release was found in both. these findings should be taken into consideration when counseling families in which cases with clinically expressed OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 are represented in several generations.. 
10721669	novel mutations of the atp7b gene in japanese patients with OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527. OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527 (wd) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation in the liver, brain, kidneys, and corneas, and culminating in copper toxication in these organs. in this study, we analyzed mutations of the responsible gene, atp7b, in four japanese patients with wd. by direct sequencing, we identified five mutations, of which two were novel, and 16 polymorphisms, of which 6 were novel. the mutations 2871delc and 2513dela shift the reading frame so that truncated abnormal protein is expected. in contrast to these mutations found in patients with hepatic-type of early onset, the mutations a874v, r778l, and 3892delgtc were either missense mutations or in frame 1-amino acid deletion, and occurred in the patients with hepato-neurologic type of late onset. the mutations 2871delc and r778l have been previously reported in a relatively large number of japanese patients. in particular, r778l is known to be more prevalent in asian countries than in other countries of the world. our data are compatible with the hypothesis that the mutations tend to occur in a population-specific manner. therefore, the accumulation of the types of mutations in japanese patients with wd will facilitate the fast and effective genetic diagnosis of wd in japanese patients.. 
7759106	structural analysis of the 5' region of mouse and human OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 genes reveals conservation of putative promoter region and di- and trinucleotide polymorphisms. we have previously cloned and characterized the murine homologue of the OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 (hd) gene and shown that it maps to mouse chromosome 5 within a region of conserved synteny with human chromosome 4p16. 3 3. here we present a detailed comparison of the sequence of the putative promoter and the organization of the 5 genomic region of the murine (hdh) and human hd genes encompassing the first five exons. we show that in this region these two genes share identical exon boundaries, but have different-size introns. two dinucleotide (ct) and one trinucleotide intronic polymorphism in hdh and an intronic ca polymorphism in the hd gene were identified. comparison of 940-bp sequence 5 to the putative translation start site reveals a highly conserved region (78. 8% nucleotide identity) between hdh and the hd gene from nucleotide -56 to -206 (of hdh). neither hdh nor the hd gene have typical tata or ccaat elements, but both show one putative ap2 binding site and numerous potential sp1 binding sites. the high sequence identity between hdh and the hd gene for approximately 200 bp 5 to the putative translation start site indicates that these sequences may play a role in regulating expression of the OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 gene 
6103091	DOID626MESHD000081208 and DOID10952MESHD009393. a report of a family. a family is described in which three children had homozygous deficiency of c3 and in which both parents and two other children were heterozygous for the c3 null gene. one child with heterozygous DOID8354 was found to have membranoproliferative DOID2921MESHD005921; DOID576MESHD011507 and/or microscopical haematuria was present in all three homozygous c3-deficient children. all children with homozygous or heterozygous DOID8354 were, to a varying degree, susceptible to MESHD007239. the only child of the family with normal complement had no increased risk of MESHD007239 and no renal DOID4MESHD004194. this family study provides further support for the proposal that DOID8354 predisposes to DOID10952MESHD009393.. 
1222588	cytogenetic investigations in families with MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684. chromosomal studies were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from five israeli-moroccan families with MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684. a total of 24 individuals, including seven propositi, was investigated. among the probands, significantly elevated rates of chromosome damage were observed in both blood and skin. skin fibroblasts of affected individuals showed several orders of magnitude more MESHD019457 than lymphocytes. increased rates of chromosome damage were also observed in the fibroblasts of some phenotypically normal family members (obligate heterozygotes and sibs) when compared to normal controls. an apparent abnormal clone of cells, possessing a large acrocentric marker chromosome (14q +), was observed in varying proportions among cells of all the propositi (2-5% of lymphocytes; 1-9% of fibroblasts).. 
7991123	predominance of the OMIM300100MESHD000326 phenotype of DOID10588OMIM300100MESHD000326 in the netherlands: a survey of 30 kindreds. DOID10588OMIM300100MESHD000326 (OMIM300100MESHD000326) is an inherited disorder of peroxisomal beta-oxidation associated with accumulation of saturated very long-chain fatty acids, which results in central and peripheral DOID3213MESHD003711 and in impaired function of adrenal cortex and testes. the phenotypic expression is highly variable, childhood cerebral OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (ccald) and OMIM300100MESHD000326 (amn) being the main variants. we explored the 30 dutch kindreds well known to the dutch OMIM300100MESHD000326/amn study group and phenotyped 77 male patients  35 (46%) had amn and 24 (31%) ccald or adolescent cerebral OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (adolcald). these percentages differ significantly from previous reports, in which 25 to 28% of the patients developed amn and 53 to 57% ccald or adolcald. our findings indicate that--at least in the netherlands--amn may be the most frequent phenotype of OMIM300100MESHD000326.. 
7550230	three novel DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 mutations in the human pax6 gene. DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 (iris hypoplasia) is an OMIM178110MESHC566739 MESHD009358 of the eye. mutations in the human DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 (pax6) gene have now been identified in many patients from various ethnic groups. in the study reported here we describe pax6 mutations in one sporadic and five familial cases with DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783. of the four different mutations identified, one was identical to a previously reported mutation (c-- > t transition at codon 240), and three were novel  two in the glycine-rich region and one in the proline/serine/threonine-rich (pst) region. one pax6 mutation found in the pst region was associated with MESHD002386 in an DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 family. another splice mutation in the pst domain occurred in an DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 patient with MESHD000857 (inability to smell). the six new DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 cases reported here have mutations predicted to generate incomplete pax6 proteins. these results support the theory that human DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 is caused by haploinsufficiency of pax6.. 
3354603	DOID687MESHD018197, pigmented ocular fundus lesions and jaw lesions in MESHD005736. DOID687MESHD018197 is a rare DOID14566DOID162MESHD009369 of infants and children only recently documented in association with hereditary OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 [kingston et al., 1983]. we report four children with DOID687MESHD018197 from four unrelated families with MESHD005736 (gs). one child, now 19 years old, survived after a resection of a DOID687MESHD018197 in infancy and recently was found to have gs. he has an associated MESHD009810 and pigmented ocular fundus lesions, both of which have been shown to be clinical markers of gs. many individuals in these four gs families, both affected and at risk, have osteomatous jaw lesions and pigmented ocular fundus lesions. a search for colonic MESHD011127 should be made in families of infants and children with DOID687MESHD018197. if the child survives, he or she should be monitored for the later appearance of colonic MESHD011127. the finding of jaw lesions and/or pigmented ocular fundus lesions in relatives at risk are indications of the possible presence of the gs gene. 
7981671	mutation spectrum in the OMIM231090OMIM303100MESHD015794DOID3590OMIM614293MESHD006828 gene of danish and swedish OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794 patients. the recent isolation of the complete open reading frame of the OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794 (OMIM231090OMIM303100MESHD015794DOID3590OMIM614293MESHD006828) gene and the characterization of the exon-intron boundaries has paved the way to mutation detection in patients with classical OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794. we have performed mutation screening in patients from 15 danish and swedish families by using southern blot hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (pcr-sscp) technique. causative mutations in the OMIM231090OMIM303100MESHD015794DOID3590OMIM614293MESHD006828 gene were detected in at least 12 families, indicating that a substantial part of the mutations can be identified by this approach. in four of these families deletions of different sizes were found. thus, in one patient, the deletion resulted in the absence of only one exon, while in another the deletion comprised the entire OMIM231090OMIM303100MESHD015794DOID3590OMIM614293MESHD006828 gene. mapping of the deletion endpoints in these four patients and in another 11 male patients with sizeable deletions enabled us to construct a very detailed map of intervals 2 and 3 of xq21. in the remaining 11 danish and swedish families at least 8 causative mutations were found by pcr-sscp analysis and direct sequencing. interestingly, all OMIM231090OMIM303100MESHD015794DOID3590OMIM614293MESHD006828 gene mutations detected thus far in OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794 patients give rise to the introduction of a premature stop codon.. 
1562739	diverse point mutations result in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) polymorphism in taiwan. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd; ec 1.1. 1. 49) deficiency is the most common human enzymopathy, affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. although greater than 400 variants have been described based on clinical and biochemical criteria, little is known about the molecular basis of these DOID2862MESHD005955. recently, the gene that encodes human g6pd has been cloned and sequenced, which enables us to examine directly the heterogeneity of g6pd at the dna level. during the past 10 years, we examined the g6pd activity in 21, 271 newborn chinese infants (11, 400 males and 9, 871 females) and identified 314 (2. 8%) males and 246 (2. 5%) females having low g6pd activity. the g6pd gene from 10 randomly selected affected individuals and their relatives was polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplified, subcloned, and sequenced. our results indicate that at least four types of mutation are responsible for the g6pd polymorphism in taiwan. the first type of mutation (487 g----a) was found in an affected chinese with a g to a change at nucleotide 487, which results in a (163) gly to ser substitution. the second type of mutation (493 a----g) is a novel mutation that has not been reported in any other ethnic group and was identified in two affected chinese. this mutation causes an a to g change at nucleotide position 493, producing an (165) asn to asp substitution. interestingly, the 487 g----a and 493 a----g mutations create alu i and OMIM209700 ii recognition sites, respectively, which enabled us to rapidly detect these two mutations by pcr/restriction enzyme (re) digestion method. the third mutation (1376 g----t) was found in four affected chinese. this mutation causes a g to t change at nucleotide position 1376 that results in an (459) arg to leu substitution. the 1376 g----t mutation seems to be the dominant allele that causes DOID2862MESHD005955 in taiwan. finally, two affected chinese were identified as having the fourth mutation (1388 g----a). this mutation causes a g to a change at nucleotide 1388 that produces an (463) arg to his substitution. our studies provide the direct proof of the genetic heterogeneity of DOID2862MESHD005955 in the chinese populations of taiwan and the pcr/re digestion method is suitable for simultaneous detection of the 487 g----a and 493 a----g mutations.
10875918	fas preassociation required for apoptosis signaling and dominant inhibition by pathogenic mutations. heterozygous mutations encoding abnormal forms of the MESHD003643 receptor fas dominantly interfere with fas-induced lymphocyte apoptosis in human OMIM601859DOID6688OMIM607271MESHD056735. this effect, rather than depending on ligand-induced receptor oligomerization, was found to stem from ligand- independent interaction of wild-type and mutant fas receptors through a specific region in the extracellular domain. preassociated fas complexes were found in living cells by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between variants of green fluorescent protein. these results show that formation of preassociated receptor complexes is necessary for fas signaling and dominant interference in human DOID4MESHD004194.. 
8434621	familial mediterranean MESHD005334 in the colchicine era: the fate of one family. in order to demonstrate the effect of prophylactic colchicine treatment on the natural history of familial mediterranean MESHD005334 (OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505), a family is presented with 6 out of 9 siblings affected by OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505. each patient represents a different stage of the amyloidotic kidney DOID4MESHD004194 of OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 and the effect of continuous colchicine treatment on its course. considered together, the members of this family present an almost complete clinical, genetic, and behavioral picture of the DOID4MESHD004194.. 
1684088	two new arylsulfatase a (arsa) mutations in a juvenile OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 (OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966) patient. fragments of the arylsulfatase a (arsa) gene from a patient with juvenile-onset OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 (OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966) were amplified by pcr and ligated into mp13 cloning vectors. clones hybridizing with cdna for human arsa were selected, examined for appropriate size inserts, and used to prepare single-stranded phage dna. examination of the entire coding and most of the intronic sequence revealed two putative DOID4MESHD004194-related mutations. one, a point mutation in exon 3, resulted in the substitution of isoleucine by serine. introduction of this alteration into the normal arsa cdna sequence resulted in a substantial decrease in arsa activity on transient expression in cultured baby hamster kidney cells. about 5% of the control expression was observed, suggesting a small residual activity in the mutated arsa. the second mutation, a g-to-a transition, occurred in the other allele and resulted in an altered splice-recognition sequence between exon 7 and the following intron. the mutation also resulted in the loss of a restriction site. apparently normal levels of mrna were generated from this allele, but no arsa activity or immuno-cross-reactive material could be detected. a collection of dna samples from known or suspected OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 patients, members of their families, and normal controls was screened for these mutations. four additional individuals carrying each of the mutations were found among the nearly 100 OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 patients in the sample. gene segregation in the original patients family was consistent with available clinical and biochemical data. no individuals homozygous for either of these two mutations were identified. however, combinations with other OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 mutations suggest that the point mutation in exon 3 does result in some residual enzyme activity and is associated with late-onset forms of the DOID4MESHD004194. the splice-site mutation following exon 7 produces late-infantile OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 when combined with other enzyme-null mutations, implying that it is completely silent enzymatically.. 
10441329	null mutation of the murine atp7b (OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527) gene results in intracellular copper accumulation and late-onset hepatic nodular transformation. the atp7b protein is a copper-transporting atpase expressed predominantly in the liver and to a lesser extent in most other tissues. mutations in the atp7b gene lead to OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527, a copper toxicity disorder characterized by dramatic build-up of intracellular hepatic copper with subsequent hepatic and neuro-logical abnormalities. using homologous recombination to disrupt the normal translation of atp7b, we have generated a MESHD013180 of mice that are homozygous mutants (null) for the OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527 gene. the atp7b null mice display a gradual accumulation of hepatic copper that increases to a level 60-fold greater than normal by 5 months of age. an increase in copper concentration was also observed in the kidney, brain, placenta and lactating mammary glands of homo-zygous mutants, although milk from the mutant glands was copper deficient. morphological abnormalities resembling DOID5082MESHD005355 developed in the majority of the livers from homozygous mutants older than 7 months of age. progeny of the homozygous mutant females demonstrated neurological abnormalities and growth retardation characteristic of copper deficiency. copper concentration in the livers of the newborn homozygous null mutants was decreased dramatically. in summary, inactivation of the murine atp7b gene produces a form of cirrhotic DOID409MESHD008107 that resembles OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527 in humans and the toxic milk phenotype in the mouse.. 
218453	OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 and OMIM300100MESHD000326 associated with partial MESHD000309 in three generations of a kindred. four cases of OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326) and one case of OMIM300100MESHD000326 (amn) have developed in a kindred over three generations demonstrating that amn is a clinical variant of OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326. pituitary-adrenal function studies were performed in 10 family members, including two affected males and four females identified as carriers of OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326/amn. no pituitary-adrenal abnormality was found in the carriers. however, basal morning plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth) levels were markedly elevated in the two males with OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 and amn, despite the fact that they had no clinical signs of MESHD000309 and that morning plasma cortisol levels and their response to maximal exogenous acth stimulation appeared to be normal. in addition, the integrated 24-hour response to the administration were also subnormal in these two cases. thus, people with OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 and amn may have subclinical partial adrenocrotical insufficiency. no other endocrinologic dysfunction was identified.. 
8566952	identification of mutations in the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326-gene of 20 families with OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326/OMIM300100MESHD000326. OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326), an x-linked DOID655, is the most frequent inborn DOID906. it leads to DOID3213MESHD003711 in the central and peripheral nervous system. defective beta-oxidation of saturated very long chain fatty acids (vlcfas; c22  0-c26  0) in peroxisomes has been shown to lead to an accumulation of vlcfas in leukoid areas of the central nervous system, peripheral nerves, adrenal gland, and blood. the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 gene has been recently identified and encodes a 745-amino-acid protein. we screened patients with OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326/OMIM300100MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326/amn) from 20 kindreds for mutations in the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 gene. eleven missense and two nonsense mutations, five deletions, and one insertion were detected by direct sequencing of eight reverse transcribed fragments of the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326-gene mrna. four mutations could be shown to be de novo. all mutations could be confirmed in carriers by sequencing genomic dna. no correlation between the type of mutation and the severity of the phenotype could be observed. the mutations were not detected in the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 gene of 30 healthy persons..

OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) is caused by abnormal expansion of a polymorphic (ctg) n repeat, located in the dm protein kinase gene. we determined the (ctg) n repeat lengths in a broad range of tissue dnas from patients with mild, classical, or congenital manifestation of dm. differences in the repeat length were seen in somatic tissues from single dm individuals and twins. repeats appeared to expand to a similar extent in tissues originating from the same embryonal origin. in most male patients carrying intermediate- or small-sized expansions in blood, the repeat lengths covered a markedly wider range in sperm. in contrast, male patients with large allele expansions in blood (> 700 ctgs) had similar or smaller repeats in sperm, when detectable. sperm alleles with > 1, 000 ctgs were not seen. we conclude that dm patients can be considered gonosomal mosaics, i. e e., combined somatic and germ-line tissue mosaics. most remarkably, we observed multiple cases where the length distributions of intermediate- or small-sized alleles in fathers sperm were significantly different from that in their offsprings blood. our combined findings indicate that intergenerational length changes in the unstable ctg repeat are most likely to occur during early embryonic mitotic divisions in both somatic and germ-line tissue formation. both the initial ctg length, the overall number of cell divisions involved in tissue formation, and perhaps a specific selection process in spermatogenesis may influence the dynamics of this process. a model explaining mitotic instability and sex-dependent segregation phenomena in dm manifestation is discussed 
10712209	combined analysis of hereditary OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 linkage to 1q24-25: results from 772 hereditary OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 families from the international consortium for OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 genetics. a previous linkage study provided evidence for a OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471-susceptibility locus at 1q24-25. subsequent reports in additional collections of families have yielded conflicting results. in addition, evidence for locus heterogeneity has been provided by the identification of other putative hereditary OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 loci on xq27-28, 1q42-43, and 1p36. the present study describes a combined analysis for six markers in the 1q24-25 region in 772 families affected by hereditary OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 and ascertained by the members of the international consortium for OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 genetics (icpcg) from north america, australia, finland, norway, sweden, and the united kingdom. overall, there was some evidence for linkage, with a peak parametric multipoint lod score assuming heterogeneity (hlod) of 1. 40 (p =. 01) at d1s212. the estimated proportion of families (alpha) linked to the locus was. 06 (1-lod support interval. 01-. 12). this evidence was not observed by a nonparametric approach, presumably because of the extensive heterogeneity. further parametric analysis revealed a significant effect of the presence of male-to-male DOID4MESHD004194 transmission within the families. in the subset of 491 such families, the peak hlod was 2. in the subset of 491 such families, the peak hlod was 2. 56 (p =. 0006) and alpha =. 11 (1-lod support interval. 04-. 19), compared with hlods of 0 in the remaining 281 families. within the families with male-to-male DOID4MESHD004194 transmission, alpha increased with the early mean age at diagnosis (< 65 years, alpha =. 19, with 1-lod support interval. 06-. 34) and the number of affected family members (five or more family members, alpha =. 15, with 1-lod support interval. 04-. 28). the highest value of alpha was observed for the 48 families that met all three criteria (peak hlod = 2. 25, p =. 001, alpha =. 29, with 1-lod support interval. 08-. 53). these results support the finding of a OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471-susceptibility gene linked to 1q24-25, albeit in a defined subset of OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 families. although OMIM601518MESHC537243 accounts for only a small proportion of all families affected by hereditary OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471, it appears to play a more prominent role in the subset of families with several members affected at an early age and with male-to-male DOID4MESHD004194 transmission.
8466512	a novel DOID4MESHD004194 with deficiency of mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase. palmitoyl-coa dehydrogenase activity in skin fibroblasts from seven patients with unidentified defects of fatty acid oxidation was measured in the presence and absence of antibodies against medium-chain, long-chain, and very-long-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenases (vlcad). two of the patients, 4-5 month old boys, were found to have a novel DOID4MESHD004194, OMIM201475MESHC536353, as judged from the results of very low palmitoyl-coa dehydrogenase activity and the lack of immunoreactivity toward antibody raised to purified vlcad.. 
1327525	inherited OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 mutation in OMIM194080DOID3764MESHD030321. patients with the OMIM194080DOID3764MESHD030321 (wilms DOID162MESHD009369, genital anomalies, and DOID557) have been demonstrated to carry de novo constitutional mutations in OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396, the wilms DOID162MESHD009369 gene at chromosome 11p13. we report three new cases, two carrying a previously described OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 exon 9 mutation and one with a novel OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 exon 8 mutation. however, unlike patients in previous reports, one of our three patients inherited the affected allele from his phenotypically unaffected father. this observation indicates that the OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 exon 9 mutation affecting 394arg demonstrated in over one-half of the patients with the OMIM194080DOID3764MESHD030321 may exhibit incomplete penetrance. consequently, familial studies in patients affected by this DOID225MESHD013577 are recommended.. 
2008213	OMIM606824MESHC562602 caused by a OMIM188560 in the na+/glucose cotransporter. OMIM606824MESHC562602 (OMIM606824MESHC562602) is an autosomal recessive DOID4MESHD004194 manifesting within the first weeks of life and characterized by a selective failure to absorb dietary glucose and galactose from the intestine. the consequent severe DOID13250 and MESHD003681 are usually fatal unless these sugars are eliminated from the diet. intestinal biopsies of OMIM606824MESHC562602 patients have revealed a specific OMIM188560 in na (+) -dependent absorption of glucose in the brush border. normal glucose absorption is mediated by the na +/glucose cotransporter in the brush border membrane of the intestinal epithelium. cellular influx is driven by the transmembrane na + electrochemical potential gradient; thereafter the sugar moves to the blood across the basolateral membrane via the facilitated glucose carrier. we have previously cloned and sequenced a na +/glucose cotransporter from normal human ileum and shown that this gene, sglt1, resides on the distal q arm of chromosome 22. we have now amplified sglt1 complementary dna and genomic dna from members of a family affected with OMIM606824MESHC562602 by the polymerase chain reaction. sequence analysis of the amplified products has revealed a single missense mutation in sglt1 which cosegregates with the OMIM606824MESHC562602 phenotype and results in a complete loss of na (+) -dependent glucose transport in xenopus oocytes injected with this complementary rna.. 
10639175	atm and bax cooperate in ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis in the central nervous system. MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 is a hereditary multisystemic DOID4MESHD004194 resulting from mutations of DOID12704OMIM208900MESHD001260, mutated (atm) and is characterized by neurodegeneration, DOID162MESHD009369, immune defects, and DOID1205MESHD006967 to ionizing radiation. the molecular details of atm function in the nervous system are unclear, although the neurological lesion in MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 becomes apparent early in life, suggesting a developmental origin. the central nervous system (cns) of atm-null mice shows a pronounced OMIM188560 in apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress, suggesting atm functions to eliminate neurons with excessive genomic damage. here, we report that the MESHD003643 effector bax is required for a large proportion of atm-dependent apoptosis in the developing cns after ionizing radiation (ir). although many of the same regions of the cns in both bax-/- and atm-/- mice were radioresistant, mice nullizygous for both bax and atm showed additional reduction in ir-induced apoptosis in the cns. therefore, although the major ir-induced apoptotic pathway in the cns requires atm and bax, a p53-dependent collateral pathway exists that has both atm- and bax-independent branches. further, atm- and bax-dependent apoptosis in the cns also required caspase-3 activation. these data implicate bax and caspase-3 as MESHD003643 effectors in neurodegenerative pathways.. 
1301190	novel OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 mutations from china. we describe three hexa mutations associated with infantile OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 (OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661) in three unrelated nonconsanguineous chinese families. novel mutations were found in two of these families. the third is a previously reported mutation (g-- > a transition at nt 1444) (nakano et al., 1988). direct sequencing of pcr products identified a novel insertion of an a after nt 547 in family 1. this change generates an early termination codon 6 bp downstream from the insertion site. allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization confirmed homozygosity in the proband. single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of amplified exon 13 revealed a t-- > c transition at nt 1453 with the corresponding amino acid substitution w485r in the second family. this mutation creates an fnu4hi restriction site. the proband is homozygous for this allele. when the site-specific mutagenized alpha cdna carrying the t-- > c transition at nt 1453 was expressed in cos 1 cells hexosaminidase s activity was not detectable above background. a g-- > a transition at nt 1444 (exon 13) corresponding to the e482k substitution was found in the third family. this mutation occurs at a cpg dinucleotide. it has been reported in an italian OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 proband and causes defective intracellular transport of the alpha-subunit from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi apparatus. 
3348216	glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and incidence of hematologic DOID162MESHD009369. we have evaluated the hypothesis of a negative association between glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency and DOID162MESHD009369 in a cohort of 481 sardinian males with DOID2531MESHD019337. the frequency of DOID2862MESHD005955 in the patients was not different from the incidence in a group of 16, 219 controls. the same conclusion resulted from the comparison of the frequency of expression of the gdb gene in 23 heterozygous women having a clonal DOID74MESHD006402 and a control group of 37 healthy heterozygotes. therefore at present there is no evidence that DOID2862MESHD005955 has a protective effect against development of hematologic DOID162MESHD009369.. 
7951316	a physical map and candidate genes in the brca1 region on chromosome 17q12-21. we have constructed a physical map of a 4 cm region on chromosome 17q12-21 that contains the hereditary breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 gene brca1. the map comprises a contig of 137 overlapping yeast artificial chromosomes and p1 clones, onto which we have placed 112 pcr markers. we have localized more than 20 genes on this map, ten of which had not been mapped to the region previously, and have isolated 30 cdna clones representing partial sequences of as yet unidentified genes. two genes that lie within a narrow region defined by meiotic breakpoints in brca1 patients have been sequenced in OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 patients without revealing any deleterious mutations. these new reagents should facilitate the identification of brca1.. 
10404839	sulfate transport is not impaired in OMIM274600DOID0060744MESHC536648 thyrocytes. OMIM274600DOID0060744MESHC536648 is the most common form of syndromic MESHD003638, characterized by DOID12175 associated with sensory-neural MESHD003638. the gene responsible for the DOID4MESHD004194 (OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648) has been cloned, but its function is as yet unknown and the connection between thyroid DOID12176MESHD006042 and sensory-neural MESHD003638 remains an enigma. OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648 codes for a novel protein, pendrin, which is closely related to a number of sufate transporters. mechanisms by which abnormal sulfate transport could deleteriously affect iodide organification have been proposed. we tested sulfate transport in thyrocytes obtained from OMIM274600DOID0060744MESHC536648 patients and found that it was not defective. this suggests that pendrin in fact may not be a sulfate transporter, and emphasizes the importance of functional studies on this novel protein.. 
10430841	spinal DOID3345MESHD014973: a variant of OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294. we describe seven dutch patients from six families with a slowly progressive, mainly spinal OMIM120970DOID0111005 DOID225MESHD013577 that remained for many years the sole expression of OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294 (OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294). mri demonstrated white matter abnormalities in the lateral and dorsal columns of the spinal OMIM120970DOID0111005. post-mortem examination of one of the patients showed extensive myelin loss in these columns. an array of genotypes was found in these patients. we conclude that spinal DOID3345MESHD014973 is a clinical and radiological separate entity of OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294 that should be OMIM612069MESHC567429OMIM606217MESHC565249OMIM115197MESHC566169DOID0110552OMIM606346DOID0110494OMIM609006OMIM300123MESHC567485DOID0111806OMIM610125MESHC566441DOID0110927OMIM161800OMIM611590MESHC566910OMIM613750MESHC563526 in the differential diagnosis of chronic DOID319MESHD013118.. 
10827109	the exon 13 duplication in the brca1 gene is a founder mutation present in geographically diverse populations. the brca1 exon 13 duplication screening group. recently, a 6-kb duplication of exon 13, which creates a frameshift in the coding sequence of the brca1 gene, has been described in three unrelated u. s s. families of european ancestry and in one portuguese family. here, our goal was to estimate the frequency and geographic diversity of carriers of this duplication. to do this, a collaborative screening study was set up that involved 39 institutions from 19 countries and OMIM612069MESHC567429OMIM606217MESHC565249OMIM115197MESHC566169DOID0110552OMIM606346DOID0110494OMIM609006OMIM300123MESHC567485DOID0111806OMIM610125MESHC566441DOID0110927OMIM161800OMIM611590MESHC566910OMIM613750MESHC563526 3, 580 unrelated individuals with a family history of the DOID4MESHD004194 and 934 early-onset breast and/or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 cases. a total of 11 additional families carrying this mutation were identified in australia (1), belgium (1), canada (1), great britain (6), and the united states (2). haplotyping showed that they are likely to derive from a common ancestor, possibly of northern british origin. our results demonstrate that it is strongly advisable, for laboratories carrying out screening either in english-speaking countries or in countries with historical links with britain, to include within their brca1 screening protocols the polymerase chain reaction-based assay described in this report. 
7493024	germline mutations of the brca1 gene in breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 families provide evidence for a genotype-phenotype correlation. mutations in the brca1 gene, discovered in 1994, are associated with an 80-90% lifetime risk of OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943. we have analysed 60 families with a history of breast and/or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 for germline mutations in brca1. twenty-two different mutations were detected in 32 families (53%), of which 14 are previously unreported. we observed a significant correlation between the location of the mutation in the gene and the ratio of breast to OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 incidence within each family. our data suggest a transition in risk such that mutations in the 3 third of the gene are associated with a lower proportion of OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. haplotype analysis supports previous data which suggest some brca1 mutation carriers have common ancestors; however, we have found at least two examples where recurrent mutations appear to have arisen independently.. 
10767347	inactivation of the OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561 mouse gene leads to early embryonic lethality without iron accumulation. OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561 (OMIM229300MESHC565561), the most common autosomal recessive MESHD001259, is caused in almost all cases by homozygous intronic expansions resulting in the loss of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein conserved through evolution, and involved in mitochondrial iron homeostasis. yeast knockout models, and histological and biochemical data from patient heart biopsies or autopsies indicate that the frataxin OMIM188560 causes a specific iron-sulfur MESHD011488 and mitochondrial iron accumulation leading to the pathological changes. affected human tissues are rarely available to further examine this hypothesis. to study the mechanism of the DOID4MESHD004194, we generated a mouse model by deletion of exon 4 leading to inactivation of the OMIM229300MESHC565561 gene product. we show that homozygous deletions cause embryonic lethality a few days after implantation, demonstrating an important role for frataxin during early development. these results suggest that the milder phenotype in humans is due to residual frataxin expression associated with the expansion mutations. surprisingly, in the frataxin knockout mouse, no iron accumulation was observed during embryonic resorption, suggesting that cell MESHD003643 could be due to a mechanism independent of iron accumulation.. 
1301189	a glycine250--> aspartate substitution in the alpha-subunit of hexosaminidase a causes juvenile-onset OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 in a lebanese-canadian family. the mutation causing juvenile OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 (OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661) in two sibs of lebanese-maronite origin is described. an mrna-containing extract of cultured fibroblasts obtained from one of the probands was used as a template to amplify the coding sequence of the hexosaminidase a (hex a) alpha-subunit. sequencing of amplified cdna fragments revealed a single alteration, guanine to adenine at nt 749 creating a g250d mutation. the mutation introduces a new recognition site for the restriction enzyme OMIM612651MESHC567210 rv, permitting identification of heterozygotes for this allele following pcr amplification and OMIM612651MESHC567210 rv digestion of exon 7 sequences from genomic dna templates. in order to test the effect of this substitution, an in vitro mutagenized cdna construct was introduced into a mammalian expression vector and transfected into monkey cos-1 cells separately or along with a beta-cdna expression vector. when the mutant alpha-cdna was the only gene introduced into cos cells no enzymatic activity above endogenous cos cell activity was detected. cotransfection of normal alpha-cdna and beta-cdna followed by immunoprecipitation of human hex a resulted in 20-fold increase in the ratio between positive and negative (mock transfection) control values. this allowed the detection of some residual activity (12% of the positive control) when the mutant alpha-cdna replaced its wild-type counterpart. the predicted protein environment in which the mutation occurs is compared to that of the adult-onset OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 mutation caused by a gly269-- > ser substitution in exon 7.

8252631	restriction of ocular fundus lesions to a specific subgroup of OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutations in DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 patients. in humans, alteration of the DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor gene, OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125, causes DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125, a condition causing predisposition to OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179. OMIM222470DOID0111414OMIM614602MESHC565627 inconsistently associates characteristic patches of congenital MESHD006984 of the retinal pigment epithelium (chrpe). ocular examination revealed that patients expressing chrpe tend to cluster within specific families. the exact OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutation was identified in 42 unrelated patients. in all cases these mutations were predicted to lead to the synthesis of a truncated protein. the extent of chrpe was found to be dependent on the position of the mutation along the coding sequence. chrpe lesions are almost always absent if the mutation occurs before exon 9, but are systematically present if it occurs after this exon. thus, the range of phenotypic expression observed among affected patients may result in part from different allelic manifestations of OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutations.. 
7759076	linkage analysis of 26 canadian breast and breast-OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 families. we have examined 26 canadian families with hereditary breast or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 for linkage to markers flanking the brca1 gene on chromosome 17q12-q21. of the 15 families that contain cases of OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051, 94% were estimated to be linked to brca1. in contrast, there was no overall evidence of linkage in the group of 10 families with OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 without OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. a genetic recombinant in a breast-OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 family indicates a placement of brca1 telomeric to d17s776, and helps to define the region of assignment of the DOID162MESHD009369 susceptibility gene. other DOID162MESHD009369 of interest that appeared in the brca1-linked families OMIM612069MESHC567429OMIM606217MESHC565249OMIM115197MESHC566169DOID0110552OMIM606346DOID0110494OMIM609006OMIM300123MESHC567485DOID0111806OMIM610125MESHC566441DOID0110927OMIM161800OMIM611590MESHC566910OMIM613750MESHC563526 primary peritoneal DOID162MESHD009369, DOID1963DOID1964MESHD005185, and malignant DOID1909MESHD008545..

MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 (a-t) is an autosomal recessive DOID225MESHD013577 associated with a greatly increased incidence of malignant DOID162MESHD009369 in homozygous affected individuals. heterozygotes for the gene for a-t are thought to comprise about 1% of the general population and, therefore, it is important to know whether this gene also predisposes the heterozygous carrier to DOID162MESHD009369. heterozygous carriers of this gene are common among the close relatives of patients with a-t, although individual carriers cannot be identified by any clinical criterion or laboratory test. for this reason, we compared the incidence of MESHD003643 from malignant DOID162MESHD009369 in 2 families of patients with a-t to that expected in a random sample of the general population. there were 59 deaths from malignant DOID162MESHD009369 in relatives dying before age 75, compared to 42. 6 expected (p less than 0. 02). for a-t heterozygotes younger than age 45, the risk of dying from a malignant DOID14566DOID162MESHD009369 was estimated to be greater than 5 times the risk for the general population. a-t heterozygotes may comprise more than 5% of all persons dying from a DOID162MESHD009369 before age 45. the incidence of ovarian, gastric, and biliary system DOID305DOID4015MESHD002277 and of DOID1240MESHD007938 and DOID0060058MESHD008223 was increased in these a-t families. other DOID162MESHD009369 that may be associated with this gene in heterozygotes include pancreatic, basal cell, colonic, breast, and cervical DOID305DOID4015MESHD002277.
2309142	molecular genetics of OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 in eastern europe: a nonsense mutation associated with haplotype 4 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 (OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661) is a DOID630MESHD030342 secondary to a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600). several mutations in the OMIM178600 gene have recently been reported, and linkage disequilibrium was observed between rflp haplotypes and specific mutations. a new molecular lesion has been identified in exon 7 of the OMIM178600 gene in a hungarian OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 patient by direct sequencing of pcr-amplified dna. the c-to-t transition causes the substitution of arg243 to a termination codon, and the mutant allele is associated with haplotype 4 of the OMIM178600 gene. the mutation is present in two of nine mutant haplotype 4 alleles among eastern europeans and is not present among western europeans and asians. the rarity of this mutant allele and its restricted geographic distribution suggest that the mutational event occurred recently on a normal haplotype 4 background in eastern europe.. 
8575748	isolation of the mouse homologue of brca1 and genetic mapping to mouse chromosome 11. the brca1 gene is in large part responsible for hereditary human breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. here we report the isolation of the murine brca1 homologue cdna clones. in addition, we identified genomic p1 clones that contain most, if not all, of the mouse brca1 locus. dna sequence analysis revealed that the mouse and human coding regions are 75% identical at the nucleotide level while the predicted amino acid identity is only 58%. a dna sequence variant in the brca1 locus was identified and used to map this gene on a (mus m. musculus czech ii x c57bl/ksj) f1 x c57bl/ksj intersubspecific backcross to distal mouse chromosome 11. the mapping of this gene to a region highly syntenic with human chromosome 17, coupled with southern and northern analyses, confirms that we isolated the murine brca1 homologue rather than a related ring finger gene. the isolation of the mouse brca1 homologue will facilitate the creation of mouse models for germline brca1 defects.. 
6783144	human deficiency of the sixth component of complement in a patient with meningococcal DOID9471MESHD008581 and no haemostasis abnormality. a case of human complete OMIM612446MESHC567307 is reported. the patient, a 31 year old white male, was seen on the occasion of an isolated episode of meningococcal DOID9471MESHD008581. serum complement hemolytic and bactericidal activities were lacking and could be restored to normal by addition of appropriate amounts of purified c6. no hemostatic abnormalities were observed.. 
1346773	the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923: refinement of the localization on xp and identification of another closely linked marker locus, oatl1. the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 (was) has previously been mapped to the proximal short arm of the x chromosome between the dxs14 and dxs7 loci. in this study, further segregation analysis has been performed using a newly identified was family as well as an additional marker probe, hoatl1. the results indicate close linkage between the was and oatl1 loci (z = 6. 08 at theta = 0. 00) and localize the timp, oatl1, dxs255, and was loci distal to dxs146 and the oatl1 and was loci proximal to timp. these linkage data narrow the boundaries within which the was locus maps to the chromosomal region bracketed by timp and dxs146 and support the loci order xpter-dxs7-timp- (oatl1, was, dxs255) -dxs146.
318684	hereditary deficiency of the third component of complement in a child with MESHD005334, skin DOID0050486MESHD005076, and MESHD018771: response to transfusion of whole blood. a previously well 34-month-old male presenting with MESHD005334, skin DOID0050486MESHD005076, and MESHD018771 was found to lack c3 by immunochemical (undetectable) and hemolytic (1% normal) assays. no infectious agent could be demonstrated. protein levels of clq. c4, c5, properdin, and c3b-ina and hemolytic activities of complement components c1 to c9 except c3 were normal or elevated; total hemolytic complement activity was 13% of normal and was reconstituted by purified c3. properdin factor b was 702 (normal 175 to 275) mug/ml, and was not cleaver upon addition of zymosan or cobra venom factor. the serum had normal immune adherence activity, but was deficient in ability to opsonize candida albicans for uptake and escherichia coli for killing by neurophils, generate neutrophil chemotactic factors and inhibit the growth of e. coli; these activities were restored by purified c3. a transfusion of 320 ml 1-hour-old normal whole blood on the fifty-second day resulted in transitory elevation of the c3 level to 25 mg/dl with a fall-off (approximately 2 1/2% per hour) to undetectable levels by 69 hours; it was followed by disappearance of the skin DOID0050486MESHD005076 and MESHD018771 and return to normal of the previously elevated temperature and crp levels. c3 levels in family members (seven of 24 half-normal), lack of anti-c3 activity, normal c3b-ina levels and a normal rate of catabolism of transfused c3 indicated that the deficiency was inherited with autosomal codominance and involved decreased synthesis of c3. thus, this child is a unique individual with inherited DOID8354 presenting with absence of repeated MESHD007239, whose symptoms of MESHD005334, skin DOID0050486MESHD005076, and MESHD018771 were abated by whole blood transfusion.. 
2544995	cloning of breakpoints of a chromosome translocation identifies the OMIM617141DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617142MESHD015783 locus. chromosome translocations involving 11p13 have been associated with familial DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 in two kindreds highlighting the chromosomal localization of the OMIM617141DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617142MESHD015783 locus. this locus is also part of the DOID14515OMIM194072MESHD017624 (wilms DOID162MESHD009369, DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783, MESHD014564, and DOID1059MESHD008607). in one kindred, the translocation is associated with a deletion, and probes for this region were used to identify and clone the breakpoints of the translocation in the second kindred. comparison of phage restriction maps exclude the presence of any sizable deletion in this case. sequences at the chromosome 11 breakpoint are conserved in multiple species, suggesting that the translocation falls within the OMIM617141DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617142MESHD015783 gene.. 
10923035	study of the voltage-gated sodium channel beta 1 subunit gene (scn1b) in the DOID14264DOID14777OMIM601764MESHD020936 (DOID0060169). DOID14264DOID14777OMIM601764MESHD020936 (DOID0060169) is a rare OMIM178110MESHC566739 DOID1826MESHD004827 DOID225MESHD013577. this DOID225MESHD013577 has been recently described in italian and french pedigrees. patients present with partial, then generalized DOID11832MESHD012640, with onset at age three months. the DOID11832MESHD012640 usually spontaneously cease after one year without treatment, leaving no neurological abnormalities. we have mapped DOID0060169 to chromosome 19q in five italian pedigrees. the sodium channel beta1 subunit gene (scn1b) maps to this candidate region and has been shown to be involved in one australian pedigree with generalized DOID1826MESHD004827 and MESHD003294 " plus " (DOID0060170 +). in this family, a missense mutation in scn1b cosegregates with the DOID0060170 + phenotype. DOID0060169 and DOID0060170 + have clinical features in common, therefore scn1b is a candidate gene for DOID0060169. we studied scn1b exons 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, using four sscp methods in 10 caucasian DOID0060169 probands of western europe. we found no exon variants. one variant was identified in intron 5 (ivs5-10c > g), which did not segregate with DOID0060169 and was observed in 9. 2% controls. a second variant in intron 5 was identified (ivs5 + 30g > a). it was rare, as not observed in controls, but not segregating with the DOID0060169 phenotype. 
7696601	brain DOID4MESHD004194 and molecular analysis in OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223. abnormal amplification of a ctg repeat on chromosome 19 is the molecular basis of OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm). expansion of the repeat has been correlated with severity of several clinical features of the DOID4MESHD004194. we performed extensive cognitive testing, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and a molecular analysis in 28 cases of dm to determine the relationship between the molecular OMIM188560 and brain DOID4MESHD004194. performance in two or more cognitive tests was pathological in 10 cases. fourteen patients had subcortical white matter lesions on mri, 14 had cerebral MESHD001284. amplification of the ctg repeat showed a strong correlation with cognitive test deficits when exceeding a length of over 1000 trinucleotides. mri lesions were associated with impaired psychometric performance, but mri and molecular findings were only weakly related. DOID4MESHD004194 duration influenced the appearance and amount of white matter lesions on mri. quantification of ctg repeat size may allow an early estimate on the probability of brain involvement in dm; MESHD060825 is associated with white matter lesions and cerebral MESHD001284 later on in the course.. 
10528853	a highly accurate, low cost test for brca1 mutations. the hereditary breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 DOID225MESHD013577 is associated with a high frequency of brca1 mutations. however, the widespread use of brca1 testing has been limited to date by three principal concerns  the fear of loss of health and life insurance, the uncertain clinical value of a positive test result, and the current lack of an inexpensive and sensitive screening test for brca1 mutations. we have developed an inexpensive system for gene mutational scanning, based on a combination of extensive multiplex pcr amplification and two dimensional electrophoresis. the efficiency of this system, as a screening test for brca1 mutations, was evaluated in a panel of 60 samples from high risk women, 14 of which contained a previously identified mutation in brca1. all 14 mutations were identified, as well as an additional five that had previously escaped detection. in addition to the 19 mutations, a total of 15 different polymorphic variants were scored, most of which were recurring. all were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. the cost of screening per sample was calculated to be approximately us $ 70 for the manual technique used in this study, and may be reduced to approximately us $ 10 with the introduction of commercially available pcr robotics and fluorescent imaging. implementation of this method of mutation screening in the research and clinical setting should permit rapid accrual of quantitative data on genotype-phenotype associations for the evaluation of diagnostic testing.. 
10083733	germline mutations of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene in korean DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 patients. we extensively analyzed genomic dna and messenger rna (mrna) from 62 unrelated korean patients with DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM105210) for identification of germline DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125) gene mutations. we adopted both single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis and a method of analysis involving the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) followed by a protein truncation test (ptt). dna sequencing confirmed all alterations represented by aberrant bands. germline mutations were identified in 38 patients (61%). nineteen of the detected mutations were presumed to be novel, thus emphasizing the heterogeneity of the mutational spectrum in korean OMIM105210 patients. in the initial 48 patients, sscp analysis was followed by ptt for those patients for whom no detectable mutations were found by sscp. using this combined approach, we identified germline OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene mutations in 29 of the 48 OMIM105210 patients (60%), including 6 patients in whom sscp analysis failed to distinguish the mutant allele. in the 14 later patients, we identified truncating mutations in 9 patients (64%) using ptt only. our results confirm that the mutation detection rate with ptt was superior to that with sscp, and suggest that ptt would be a more practical screening method to detect germline mutations of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene in OMIM105210 patients.
10842298	homozygosity mapping in a family with DOID10907MESHD008831, DOID1059MESHD008607, and short OMIM475000 to a OMIM216550DOID0111590MESHC536438 region on 8q21.3-8q22.1: redefining a clinical entity. a DOID225MESHD013577 of DOID10907MESHD008831, progressive postnatal growth deficiency, and DOID1059MESHD008607 was observed in two brothers and their cousin from a multiply consanguineous kindred of lebanese descent. MESHD009123, chorioretinal dystrophy, and DOID11830OMIM608367MESHD009216 were also identified. the severity of the condition varied among the closely related patients. because of absence of a distinctive facial appearance, the degree of DOID1059MESHD008607, and short OMIM475000, the initially considered clinical diagnosis of OMIM216550DOID0111590MESHC536438 was withdrawn and a novel genetic entity was assumed. homozygosity mapping in this family assigned the gene to a 26. 8-cm region on the chromosome band 8q21. 3 -22. 1, between the microsatellites at d8s270 and d8s514. the maximum two-point lod score was found for marker at d8s267 (zmax = 3.. 237 at omax = 0. 00). intriguingly enough, the identified gene region overlaps the refined gene region for OMIM216550DOID0111590MESHC536438 (OMIM216550DOID0111590MESHC536438) [kolehmainen et al., 1997  euro j hum genet 5  206-213]. this fact encourages the hypothesis that the described kindred segregates for a variant of OMIM216550DOID0111590MESHC536438 and suggests a redefinition of its phenotype 
2835825	spontaneous reversion of novel lesch-nyhan mutation by hprt gene rearrangement. molecular analysis of an unusual patient with the OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926 has suggested that the mutation is due to a partial hprt gene duplication. we now report the cloning and sequencing of the mutant hprt cdna which shows the precise duplication of exons 2 and 3. this mutation is the result of an internal duplication of 16-20 kilobases of the gene. the structure of the mutant gene suggests that the duplication was not generated by a single unequal crossing-over event between two normal hprt alleles. growth of epstein-barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from this patient in selective medium has permitted isolation of spontaneous hprt + revertants of this mutation. the reversion event involves a second major hprt gene rearrangement where most or all of the duplicated portion of the mutant gene is deleted. the original mutation therefore has the potential for spontaneous somatic reversion. this may explain the relatively mild symptoms of the OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926 exhibited by this patient.. 
7422429	DOID557 in the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923. DOID557 was detected in five of 32 patients with the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 who were participating in a study of transfer factor (tf) therapy. in two patients, DOID557 was present before tf and did not appear changed by tf therapy. one of these patients subsequently developed progressive DOID1074MESHD051437 requiring dialysis beginning 5 1/2 years after tf therapy. in two patients, decreased renal function appeared very soon after the administration of tf. one patient showed gradually decreasing renal function beginning after two years of tf therapy. an additional patient was identified who died with DOID1074MESHD051437 without having received tf. the results suggest that DOID1074MESHD051437 occurs in the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 more frequently than generally recognized and that administration of tf may precipitate or accelerate the renal DOID4MESHD004194 in patients with this DOID225MESHD013577.. 
7795596	DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783-associated cytogenetic rearrangements suggest that a position effect may cause the mutant phenotype. current evidence suggests that DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 (absence of iris) is caused by loss of function of one copy of the pax6 gene, which maps to 11p13. we present the further characterisation of two DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 pedigrees in which the DOID4MESHD004194 segregates with chromosomal rearrangements which involve 11p13 but do not disrupt the pax6 gene. we have isolated three human yac clones which encompass the pax6 locus and we have used these to show that in both cases the chromosomal breakpoint is at least 85 kb distal of the 3 end of pax6. in addition, the open reading frame of pax6 is apparently free of mutations. we propose that the pax6 gene on the rearranged chromosome 11 is in an inappropriate chromatin environment for normal expression and therefore that a position effect is the underlying mechanism of DOID4MESHD004194 in these families.. 
7962532	genetic cholesteryl ester transfer MESHD011488 caused by two prevalent mutations as a major determinant of increased levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. genetic determinants of hdl cholesterol (hdl-c) levels in the general population are poorly understood. we previously described plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (cetp) deficiency due to an intron 14 g (+ 1) -to-a mutation (int14 a) in several families with very high hdl-c levels in japan. subjects with hdl-c > or = 100 mg/dl (n = 130) were screened by pcr single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of the cetp gene. two other mutations were identified by dna sequencing or primer-mediated restriction map modification of pcr products  a novel intron 14 splice donor site mutation caused by a t insertion at position + 3 from the exon14/intron14 boundary (int14 t) and a missense mutation (asp442 to gly) within exon 15 (d442g). the int14 t mutation was only found in one family. however, the d442g and int14 a mutations were highly prevalent in subjects with hdl-c > or = 60 mg/dl, with combined allele frequencies of 9%, 12%, 21% and 43% for hdl-c 60-79, 80-99, 100-119, and > or = 120 mg/dl, respectively. furthermore, prevalences of the d442g and int14 a mutations were extremely high in a general sample of japanese men (n = 236), with heterozygote frequencies of 7% and 2%, respectively. these two mutations accounted for about 10% of the total variance of hdl-c in this population. the phenotype in a genetic compound heterozygote (int14 t and int14 a) was similar to that of int14 a homozygotes (no detectable cetp and markedly increased hdl-c), indicating that the int14 t produces a null allele. in four d442g homozygotes, mean hdl-c levels (86 +/- 26 mg/dl) were lower than in int14 a homozygotes (158 +/- 35 mg/dl), reflecting residual cetp activity in plasma. in 47 d442g heterozygotes, mean hdl-c levels were 91 +/- 23 mg/dl, similar to the level in d442g homozygotes, and significantly greater than mean hdl-c levels in int14 a heterozygotes (69 +/- 15 mg/dl). thus, the d442g mutation acts differently to the null mutations with weaker effects on hdl in the homozygous state and stronger effects in the heterozygotes, suggesting dominant expression of a partially defective allele. OMIM143470DOID0111369MESHC564591, reflecting two prevalent mutations (d442g and int14 a), is the first example of a genetic deficiency state which is sufficiently common to explain a significant fraction of the variation in hdl-c in the general population.. 
3377761	x-linked DOID2862MESHD005955 in mus musculus. a mouse with x-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency has been recovered in offspring of 1-ethyl-1-nitrosourea-treated male mice. the activity alteration was detected in blood but can also be observed in other tissue extracts. hemizygous, heterozygous, and homozygous mutants have, respectively, about 15, 60, and 15% g6pd remaining activity in the blood as compared to the wild type. erythrocyte indices did not show differences between mutants and wild types. the mutation does not affect the electrophoretic migration, the isoelectric point, or the thermal stability. kinetic properties, such as the km for glucose-6-phosphate or for nadp and the relative utilization of substrate analogues, showed no differences between wild types and mutants with the exception of the relative utilization of deamino-nadp which was significantly lower in mutants. this is presently the only animal model for x-linked DOID2862MESHD005955 in humans.. 
10798358	human glycine decarboxylase gene (gldc) and its highly conserved processed pseudogene (psigldc): their structure and expression, and the identification of a large deletion in a family with DOID9268OMIM605899MESHD020158. mutations in the glycine decarboxylase gene (gldc) cause DOID9268OMIM605899MESHD020158 (OMIM605899), an in-born error of metabolism characterized by severe neurological disturbance. we have determined the structure of gldc and of its pseudogene (psigldc) and studied their expression for a molecular analysis of OMIM605899. the gldc gene spans at least 135 kb and consists of 25 exons. all donor and acceptor sites adhere to the canonical gt-ag rule, except for the donor site of intron 21, where a variant form gc is used instead of gt. the transcription initiation site has been assigned to a residue 163 bp upstream from the translation initiation triplet by primer extension analysis. the psigldc gene has no intron and shares 97. 5% homology with the coding region of functional gldc, suggesting that psigldc is a processed pseudogene that arose from the gldc transcript about 4-8 million years ago. rna blotting analysis has revealed that gldc is expressed in human liver, kidney, brain, and placenta. we have also examined a patient with OMIM605899 with no detectable gldc mrna in his lymphoblasts. exons 1-3 of the functional gldc gene from this patient are not amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), whereas those from control subjects are. these results suggest a large homozygous deletion (at least 30 kb) in the patient. furthermore, we have devised a semi-quantitative pcr to estimate the number of gldc alleles by using psigldc as an internal control and have confirmed the homozygosity and heterozygosity of the deletion in the patient and his parents, respectively. structural information of gldc and psigldc should facilitate the molecular analysis of OMIM605899. 
8589721	growth retardation and tumour inhibition by brca1. inherited mutations in brca1 predispose to breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051, but the role of brca1 in sporadic breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 has previously been elusive. here, we show that retroviral transfer of the wild-type brca1 gene inhibits growth in vitro of all breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 cell lines tested, but not colon or OMIM211980DOID1324DOID3683OMIM608935OMIM612052OMIM612571OMIM612593OMIM614210MESHD008175 cells or fibroblasts. mutant brca1 has no effect on growth of OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 cells; OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 cell growth is not affected by brca1 mutations in the 5 portion of the gene, but is inhibited by 3 brca1 mutations. development of mcf-7 tumours in nude mice is inhibited when mcf-7 cells are transfected with wild-type, but not mutant, brca1. most importantly, among mice with established mcf-7 tumours, peritoneal treatment with a retroviral vector expressing wild-type brca1 significantly inhibits tumour growth and increased survival.. 
126380	striking prevalence of ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166 in "healthy" w27 positive males and females. ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166 is diagnosed once or twice in each 1000 males and one tenth as frequently in females, but the true prevalence is unknown. indentification of genetic marker, hl-a w27, for susceptible persons has provided a tool facilitating epidemiologic studies and allowing identification of " control " populations without the marker. evaluation by postal questionnaires, and pelvic radiography of 78 hl-a 27w-positive blood donors selected from a group of apparently healthy subjects revealed 14 who satisfied the criteria for definite ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166. the prevalence was similar in both sexes. one hundred and twenty-six w27-negative controls matched for race, sex, and age failed to yield a single case. for a person of either sex with hl-a w27, there appears to be about a 20 per cent chance that ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166 will develop, suggesting a prevalence of 10 to 15 per thousand. hitherto accepted figures may underestimate the frequency by a factor of 10 to 20.. 
7663517	rapid detection of brca1 mutations by the protein truncation test. more than 75% of the reported mutations in the hereditary breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 gene, brca1, result in truncated proteins. we have used the protein truncation test (ptt) to screen for mutations in exon 11, which encodes 61% of brca1. in 45 patients from breast and/or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 families we found six novel mutations  two single nucleotide insertions, three small deletions (1-5 bp) and a nonsense mutation identified two unrelated families. furthermore, we were able to amplify the remaining coding region by rt-pcr using lymphocyte rna. combined with ptt, we detected aberrantly spliced products affecting exons 5 and 6 in one of two brca1-linked families examined. the protein truncation test promises to become a valuable technique in detecting brca1 mutations.. 
1376553	new variant in exon 3 of the proteolipid protein (plp) gene in a family with pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194. a c--greater than g transversion has been found in exon 3 of the plp gene of affected males and their mother in a single sibship with pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 (OMIM312080OMIM601186DOID3210OMIM169500MESHD020371). the transversion should not result in an amino acid change in the protein but it does result in the loss of a haeiii restriction endonuclease cleavage site. it is concordant with the DOID4MESHD004194 in this family. one-hundred-ten unrelated x chromosomes are negative for this mutation. no other sequence OMIM188560 was found in the plp exons of the affected males. the cause of DOID4MESHD004194 in this family remains unknown, but the association between this rare mutation and OMIM312080OMIM601186DOID3210OMIM169500MESHD020371 is intriguing. the mutation can serve as a marker for following segregation of the plp gene.. 
7390473	variants of erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) in bulgarian populations. ten variants of erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were identified in 22 patients with DOID2862MESHD005955 from three districts of bulgaria. corinth-like and fayoum-like variants were the most frequent; mediterranean, ohut ii, kilgore, boston, poznan, and panay variants and two new variants, petrich and gotze delchev, were each found in one or two carriers. no correlation was revealed between clinical and biochemical polymorphism.. 
10381492	the c282y mutation causing hereditary OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 does not produce a null allele. targeted mutagenesis was used to produce two mutations in the murine OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 gene (OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432) locus. the first mutation deletes a large portion of the coding sequence, generating a null allele. the second mutation introduces a missense mutation (c282y) into the OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 locus, but otherwise leaves the gene intact. this mutation is identical to the DOID4MESHD004194-causing mutation in patients with hereditary OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432. mice carrying each of the two mutations were bred and analyzed. homozygosity for either mutation results in postnatal iron loading. the effects of the null mutation are more severe than the effects of the c282y mutation. mice heterozygous for either mutation accumulate more iron than normal controls. interestingly, although liver iron stores are greatly increased, splenic iron is decreased. we conclude that the c282y mutation does not result in a null allele.. 
2209091	regional localisation of the OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561 locus to human chromosome 9q13----q21.1. we have previously assigned the OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561 locus (OMIM229300MESHC565561) to chromosome 9; the current maximal lod score between OMIM229300MESHC565561 and mct112 (d9s15) is greater than 50 at a recombination fraction of theta = 0. the physical assignment of the locus defined by mct112, and hence OMIM229300MESHC565561, has not been determined, although linkage analysis of mct112 with other chromosome 9 markers inferred a location close to the centromere. we have used in situ hybridisation with mct112, a corresponding cosmid mj1, and dr47 (d9s5), coupled with mapping studies on hybrid cell panels, to define more precisely the location of the DOID4MESHD004194 locus. the in situ location of all three probes is 9q13----q21. 1, distal to the variable heterochromatin region. physical assignment of OMIM229300MESHC565561 will allow us to identify hybrid cell lines containing the mutated gene. 
10470286	mxi1 mutations in human DOID3512DOID5940MESHD018319. mxi1 is thought to negatively regulate myc function and may therefore be a potential DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor gene. little effort has yet been made to find alterations involving this gene in human solid DOID162MESHD009369. we screened 31 human gastric DOID162MESHD009369, 7 esophageal DOID162MESHD009369, 85 bone and OMIM614813 tissue DOID162MESHD009369 of various types, including 4 DOID3512DOID5940MESHD018319. we also examined 29 human DOID162MESHD009369 cell lines consisting of 12 esophageal DOID162MESHD009369, 7 DOID3070DOID5076OMIM137800OMIM607248OMIM613028OMIM613029OMIM613030OMIM613031OMIM613033OMIM616568MESHD005910/DOID3068DOID3074MESHD005909 and 10 others for mxi1 mutations in exons 1, 2, 4 (hlh domain), 5 and 6. polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (pcr-sscp) and subsequent sequencing revealed three distinct polymorphisms in the intron-exon boundary upstream from exon 6. we discovered a missense mutation, OMIM187360 to gta (ala 54 val), in exon 2 in a DOID3512DOID5940MESHD018319 patient (case 1), two missense mutations, OMIM100070MESHC565230 to OMIM607842MESHC564321 (lys 118 gln) and gaa to gga (glu 154 gly) in exon 5 of another DOID3512DOID5940MESHD018319 patient (case 2), and 3 amino acid substitutions, gtg to gcg (val 179 ala), gtt to gct (val 181 ala) and ttc to ctc (phe 186 leu), in a third DOID3512DOID5940MESHD018319 patient (case 3). in case 3, loss of heterozygosity was also demonstrated by informative (ttc) 3/(ttc) 2 polymorphism. our data demonstrate that mutations occur in the mxi1 gene in DOID3512DOID5940MESHD018319. missense mutations in the functional domain of mxi1 in these cases may be involved in the pathogenesis of DOID3512DOID5940MESHD018319.. 
7833921	molecular basis of DOID0111680: molecular cloning and mutational analysis of human ketohexokinase (fructokinase). DOID0111680 is one of the oldest known DOID655MESHD008661. it is a benign condition which is believed to result from deficiency of hepatic fructokinase (ketohexokinase, khk, e. c. 2. 7. 1. 3). this enzyme catalyses the first step of metabolism of dietary fructose, conversion of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate. despite the early recognition of this disorder, the primary structure of human khk and the molecular basis of DOID0111680 have not been previously defined. in this report, the isolation and sequencing of full-length cdna clones encoding human ketohexokinase are described. alternative mrna species and alternative khk isozymes are produced by alternative polyadenylation and splicing of the khk gene. the khk proteins show a high level of sequence conservation relative to rat khk. direct evidence that mutation of the khk structural gene is the cause of DOID0111680 was also obtained. in a well-characterized family, in which three of eight siblings have DOID0111680OMIM229800MESHC538068, all affected individuals are compound heterozygotes for two mutations gly40arg and ala43thr. both mutations result from g-- > a transitions, and each alters the same conserved region of the khk protein. neither mutation was seen in a sample of 52 unrelated control individuals. an additional conservative amino acid change (val49iie) was present on the khk allele bearing ala43thr 
10449794	loss of the MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 gene product causes oxidative damage in target organs. MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 (a-t) is characterized by a markedly increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation, increased incidence of DOID162MESHD009369, and neurodegeneration, especially of the cerebellar purkinje cells. ionizing radiation oxidizes macromolecules and causes tissue damage through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ros). we therefore hypothesized that a-t is due to oxidative damage resulting from loss of function of the a-t gene product. to assess this hypothesis, we employed an animal model of a-t, the mouse with a disrupted atm gene. we show that organs which develop pathologic changes in the atm-deficient mice are targets of oxidative damage, and that cerebellar purkinje cells are particularly affected. these observations provide a mechanistic basis for the a-t phenotype and lay a rational foundation for therapeutic intervention.. 
6604602	family studies in bechterew's DOID225MESHD013577 (ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166) iii. genetics. the results of segregation analyses in 75 families where the proband had ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166, are presented. of the 278 adult, living first degree relatives, approximately 85% cooperated in the study. clinical and radiographical examinations were performed and hla typing was conducted. the results were in agreement with our hypothesis that ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166 is part of a DOID225MESHD013577 where different genetic factors interact. such known factors are hla b27 associated DOID4MESHD004194 susceptibility, susceptibility to DOID9008OMIM607507MESHD015535 and susceptibility to entero-DOID381MESHD007592. radiographical sacro-iliitis was restricted to hla b27 positive relatives, and was more frequently found in relatives to probands with DOID8893DOID4398OMIM177900OMIM601454OMIM602723OMIM603935OMIM604316OMIM605364OMIM605606OMIM607857OMIM610707OMIM612410OMIM612599OMIM612950OMIM614070OMIM614204OMIM616106MESHD011565 than in relatives to probands without DOID8893DOID4398OMIM177900OMIM601454OMIM602723OMIM603935OMIM604316OMIM605364OMIM605606OMIM607857OMIM610707OMIM612410OMIM612599OMIM612950OMIM614070OMIM614204OMIM616106MESHD011565. environmental factors (intestinal bacteria) are known to trigger the DOID4MESHD004194 at least in some persons, and we have postulated that all or most of them have the predisposition to develop DOID4MESHD004194. thus, OMIM222470DOID0111414OMIM614602MESHC565627 has a multifactorial etiology. the phenotypic expressions of the different MESHD020022 involved, include sacro-iliitis, DOID8893DOID4398OMIM177900OMIM601454OMIM602723OMIM603935OMIM604316OMIM605364OMIM605606OMIM607857OMIM610707OMIM612410OMIM612599OMIM612950OMIM614070OMIM614204OMIM616106MESHD011565, acute DOID1407MESHD014606, peripheral DOID381MESHD007592 and DOID0050589OMIM266600MESHD015212. we suggest the descriptive name hereditary multifocal relapsing MESHD007249 (hemri) for this DOID225MESHD013577. ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166, DOID9008OMIM607507MESHD015535 and entero-DOID381MESHD007592 may be regarded as clinical sub-types of OMIM222470DOID0111414OMIM614602MESHC565627.. 
1315306	chromosome mapping of the rod photoreceptor cgmp phosphodiesterase beta-subunit gene in mouse and human: tight linkage to the OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 region (4p16.3). the DOID8466MESHD012162 mouse (gene OMIMMIM Number, rd) is an animal model for certain forms of human hereditary retinopathies. recent findings of a nonsense mutation in the rd mouse OMIM266100OMIM617290MESHC536254 beta-subunit gene (pdeb) prompted us to investigate the chromosome locations of the mouse and human genes. we have utilized backcross analysis in mice to verify and define more precisely the location of the pdeb locus 6. 1 +/- 2. 3 cm distal of mgsa on mouse chromosome 5. we have determined that the human gene (pdeb) maps to 4p16. 3, very close to the OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 (hd) region. analysis of the comparative map for mice and humans shows that the mouse homologue of the hd gene will reside on chromosome 5. linkage of the mouse pdeb locus with other homologues in the human 4p16. 3 region is maintained but gene order is not, suggesting at least three possible sites for the corresponding mouse hd gene.
777027	hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement in man. ii. biological properties of c5-deficient human serum. the first known human kindred with hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement (c5) was documented in the accompanying report. this study examines several biological properties of c5-deficient (OMIM609536MESHC537005) human serum, particularly sera obtained from two OMIM609536MESHC537005 homozygotes. the proband, who has inactive systemic DOID8857 is completely lacking c5, while her healthy half-sister has 1-2% of normal levels. both sera were severely impaired in their ability to generate chemotactic activity for normal human neutrophils upon incubation with aggregated human gamma-globulin or escherichia coli endotoxin. this function was fully restored in the siblings serum, and substantially improved in the probands serum, by addition of highly purified human c5 to normal serum concentrations. sera from eight family members who were apparently heterozygous for OMIM609536DOID8158MESHC537005 gave normal chemotactic scores. the ability of OMIM609536MESHC537005 serum to opsonize saccharomyces cerevisiae (bakers yeast) or candida albicans for ingestion by normal neutrophils was completely normal. in addition, OMIM609536MESHC537005 serum was capable of promoting normal phagocytosis and intracellular killing of staphylococcus aureus. the probands serum was incapable of mediating lysis of erythrocytes from a patient with DOID0060284OMIM300818OMIM615399MESHD006457 in both the sucrose hemolysia and acid MESHD006461 tests, and also lacked bactericidal activity against sensitized or unsensitized salmonella typhi. the siblings serum, containing only 1-2% of normal c5, effectively lysed s. typhi, but only at eightfold lower serum dilutions as compared to normals. these findings underscore the critical role of c5 in the generation of chemotactic activity and in cytolytic reactions, as opposed to a nonobligatory or minimal role in opsonization, at least for the organisms under study.. 
10807793	the gene for familial mediterranean MESHD005334, mefv, is expressed in early leukocyte development and is regulated in response to inflammatory mediators. familial mediterranean MESHD005334 (OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of MESHD005334 and neutrophil-mediated serosal MESHD007249. we recently identified the gene causing OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505, designated mefv, and found it to be expressed in mature neutrophils, suggesting that it functions as an inflammatory regulator. to facilitate our understanding of the normal function of mefv, we extended our previous studies. mefv messenger rna was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow leukocytes, with differential expression observed among cells by in situ hybridization. cd34 hematopoietic stem-cell cultures induced toward the granulocytic lineage expressed mefv at the myelocyte stage, concurrently with lineage commitment. the prepromyelocytic cell line hl60 expressed mefv only at granulocytic and monocytic differentiation. mefv was also expressed in the monocytic cell lines u937 and thp-1. among peripheral blood leukocytes, mefv expression was detected in neutrophils, eosinophils, and to varying degrees, monocytes. consistent with the tissue specificity of expression, complete sequencing and analysis of upstream regulatory regions of mefv revealed homology to myeloid-specific promoters and to more broadly expressed inflammatory promoter elements. in vitro stimulation of monocytes with the proinflammatory agents interferon (ifn) gamma, DOID162MESHD009369 MESHD009336 factor, and lipopolysaccharide induced mefv expression, whereas the antiinflammatory cytokines interleukin (il) 4, il-10, and transforming growth factor beta inhibited such expression. induction by ifn-gamma occurred rapidly and was resistant to cycloheximide. ifn-alpha also induced mefv expression. in granulocytes, mefv was up-regulated by ifn-gamma and the combination of ifn-alpha and colchicine. these results refine understanding of mefv by placing the gene in the myelomonocytic-specific proinflammatory pathway and identifying it as an ifn-gamma immediate early gene.. 
10556283	spectrum of hsnf5/ini1 somatic mutations in human DOID162MESHD009369 and genotype-phenotype correlations. the hsnf5/ini1 gene which encodes a member of the swi/snf chromatin atp-dependent remodeling complex, is a new DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor gene localized on chromosome 22q11. 2 and recently shown to be mutated in malignant MESHD018335. we have searched for hsnf5/ini1 mutations in 229 DOID162MESHD009369 of various origins using a screening method based on denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. a total of 31 homozygous deletions and 36 point alterations were identified. point mutations were scattered along the coding sequence and OMIM612069MESHC567429OMIM606217MESHC565249OMIM115197MESHC566169DOID0110552OMIM606346DOID0110494OMIM609006OMIM300123MESHC567485DOID0111806OMIM610125MESHC566441DOID0110927OMIM161800OMIM611590MESHC566910OMIM613750MESHC563526 15 nonsense, 15 frameshift, three splice site, two missense and one editing mutations. mutations were retrieved in most MESHD018335, whatever their sites of occurrence, indicating the common pathogenetic origin of these DOID162MESHD009369. recurrent hsnf5/ini1 alterations were also observed in choroid plexus DOID305DOID4015MESHD002277 and in a subset of central DOID0050902DOID4790DOID4794DOID7398MESHD018242 (cpnets) and DOID0050902DOID3861DOID3864DOID3868DOID3869OMIM155255MESHD008527. in contrast, hsnf5/ini1 point mutations were not detected in breast DOID162MESHD009369, wilms DOID162MESHD009369, DOID3070DOID5076OMIM137800OMIM607248OMIM613028OMIM613029OMIM613030OMIM613031OMIM613033OMIM616568MESHD005910, DOID4844DOID5075DOID5500DOID5505MESHD004806, DOID4235DOID6193MESHD012509 and other DOID162MESHD009369 types, even though most analyzed cases harbored loss of heterozygosity at 22q11. 2 loci. these results suggest that MESHD018335, choroid plexus DOID305DOID4015MESHD002277 and a subset of DOID0050902DOID3861DOID3864DOID3868DOID3869OMIM155255MESHD008527 and cpnets share common pathways of MESHD063646 related to hsnf5/ini1 alteration and that hsnf5/ini1 mutations define a genetically homogeneous family of highly aggressive DOID162MESHD009369 mainly occurring in young children and frequently, but not always, exhibiting a rhabdoid phenotype 
624546	heterogeneity of DOID2862MESHD005955 in algeria. study in northern algeria with description of five new variants. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency was found in 3. 2% of the male population living in the urban area of algiers. the deficient subjects originated from multiple geographic regions of northern algeria, with prevalence of individuals of berber-kabyle origin. red blood cell g6pd was partially purified and characterized in deficient males from 17 families, and six different variants were found. among them, only one, the gd (-) kabyle variant, had been previously described. it was detected in nine families. the other five variants were new  gd (-) laghouat (four cases), gd (-) blida (one case), gd (-) thenia (one case), gd (-) titteri (one case), and gd (-) alger (two brothers). strikingly, the common mediterranean variant was not found. DOID2862MESHD005955 is heterogeneous in northern algeria where autochtonous variants seem to prevail. the kabyle variant may be common in this country. 
1302032	OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600 without ccg amplification has an fmr1 deletion. we describe a patient with typical clinical features of the OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600, but without cytogenetic expression of the fragile x or an amplified ccg trinucleotide repeat fragment. the patient has a previously uncharacterized submicroscopic deletion encompassing the ccg repeat, the entire fmr1 gene and about 2. 5 megabases of flanking sequences. this finding confirms that the fragile x phenotype can exist, without amplification of the ccg repeat or cytogenetic expression of the fragile x, and that OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600 is a genetically homogeneous disorder involving fmr1. we also found random x-inactivation in the mother of the patient who was shown to be a carrier of this deletion.

DOID0060239OMIM119300MESHC536528 (vws) is an OMIM178110MESHC566739 craniofacial disorder with high penetrance and variable expression. its clinical features are variably expressed, but include DOID9296MESHD002971 and/or OMIM119540DOID674MESHD002972MESHC566991, OMIM247610 pits and DOID0050591OMIM106600MESHD000848. all vws families studied to date map the DOID4MESHD004194 gene to a < 2 cm region of chromosome 1q32, with no evidence of locus heterogeneity. the aim of this study is to refine the localization of the vws gene and to further assess possible heterogeneity. we analyzed four multiplex vws families. all available members were clinically assessed and genotyped for 19 short tandem repeat markers on chromosome 1 in the vws candidate gene region. we performed two-point and multipoint limit of detection (lod) score analyses using a high penetrance OMIM178110MESHC566739 model. all families showed positive lod scores without any recombination in the candidate region. the largest two-point lod score was 5. 87 87. our assay method for short tandem repeat (str) markers provided highly accurate size estimation of marker allele fragment sizes, and therefore enabled us to determine the specific alleles segregating with the vws gene in each of our four families. we observed a striking pattern of str allele sharing at several closely linked loci among our four caucasian vws families recruited at three different locations in the us. these results suggest the possibility of a unique origin for a mutation responsible for many or most cases of vws. 
7550349	the carrier frequency of the brca1 185delag mutation is approximately 1 percent in ashkenazi jewish individuals. since brca1, the first major gene responsible for inherited OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943, was cloned, more than 50 unique mutations have been detected in the germline of individuals with breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. in high-risk pedigrees, female carriers of brca1 mutations have an 80-90% lifetime risk of OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943, and a 40-50% risk of OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. however, the mutation stats of individuals unselected for breast or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 has not been determined, and it is not known whether mutations in such individuals confer the same risk of DOID162MESHD009369 as in individuals from the high-risk families studied so far. following the finding of a 185delag frameshift mutation in several ashkenazi jewish breast/ovarian families, we have determined the frequency of this mutation in 858 ashkenazim seeking genetic testing for conditions unrelated to DOID162MESHD009369, and in 815 reference individuals not selected for ethnic origin. we observed the 185delag mutation in 0. 9% of ashkenazim (95% confidence limit, 0. 4-1. 8%) and in none of the reference samples. our results suggest that one in a hundred women of ashkenazi descent may be at especially high risk of developing breast and/or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051.
8460149	targeted modification of the apolipoprotein b gene results in DOID1390MESHD006995 and developmental abnormalities in mice. DOID1386DOID1390MESHD006995 is an autosomal codominant disorder resulting in a dramatic reduction in plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein (apo) b, cholesterol, and beta-migrating lipoproteins. a benefit of DOID1390MESHD006995 is that mildly affected individuals may be protected from coronary DOID178MESHD014652. we have used gene targeting to generate mice with a modified apob allele. mice containing this allele display all of the hallmarks of human DOID1390MESHD006995  they produce a truncated apob protein, apob70, and have markedly decreased plasma concentrations of apob, beta-lipoproteins, and total cholesterol. in addition, the mice manifest several characteristics that are occasionally observed in human DOID1390MESHD006995, including reduced plasma triglyceride concentrations, fasting chylomicronemia, and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol. an unexpected finding is that the modified apob allele is strongly associated with exencephalus and DOID10908DOID14159DOID1573OMIM236600MESHD006849. these mice should help increase our understanding of DOID1390MESHD006995, DOID2348OMIM108725MESHD050197, and the etiology of exencephalus and DOID10908DOID14159DOID1573OMIM236600MESHD006849.. 
10398279	common mutations in brca1 and brca2 do not contribute to early OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 in jewish men. background  families with a high incidence of hereditary OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943, and subsequently shown to have terminating mutations in brca1 or brca2, appear to have a higher incidence of OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 among male relatives. we aimed to determine whether the common germline mutations of brca1 or brca2 in ashkenazi jewish men predisposed them to OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471. methods  we examined genomic dna from 83 (for brca1 185delag) or 82 (for brca2 6174delt) ashkenazi jewish OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 patients, most of whom were treated at a relatively young age, for the most common germline mutation in each gene seen in the ashkenazi population. results  our study should have been able to detect a 4-5-fold increase in the risk of OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 due to mutation of brca1 or brca2. however, only one (1. 15%; 95% confidence interval, 0-3. 6%) of the patients was heterozygous for the brca1 mutant allele, and only two were heterozygous for the brca2 mutation (2. 4%; 95% confidence interval, 0-6. 2%). conclusions  the incidence of each of the germline mutations in these OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 patients closely matched their incidence (about 1%) in the general ashkenazi jewish population. this suggests that unlike cases of breast and DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051, mutations in brca1 or brca2 do not significantly predispose men to OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 
3565372	two new variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase associated with hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740: g6pd wayne and g6pd huron. two new deficient variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) causing hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740 (DOID2861) are described. both of these are unique and they have been named g6pd wayne and g6pd huron. patients with g6pd wayne underwent splenectomy and no objective improvement was noted. the patients with g6pd huron were under medical observation for a considerable period of time without the diagnosis of DOID2862MESHD005955 being entertained because the family was of northern european origin. since sporadic variants of g6pd causing DOID2861 show no special racial predilection, the diagnosis of DOID2862MESHD005955 should always be considered in patients with this DOID225MESHD013577.. 
6650504	the OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 gene in north american jewish populations: geographic variations and origin. from data collected in a north american OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 (OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661) heterozygote screening program, the OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 carrier frequency among 46, 304 jewish individuals was found to be. 0324 (1 in 31 individuals). this frequency is consistent with earlier estimates based on OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 incidence data. OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 carrier frequencies were then examined by single country and single region of origin in 28, 029 jews within this sample for whom such data were available for analysis. jews with polish and/or russian ancestry constituted 88% of this sample and had a OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 carrier frequency of. 0327. no OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 carriers were observed among the 166 jews of near eastern origins. relative to jews of polish and russian origins, there was at least a twofold increase in the OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 carrier frequency in jews of austrian, hungarian, and czechoslovakian origins (p less than. 005). these findings suggest that the OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 gene proliferated among the antecedents of modern ashkenazi jewry after the second diaspora (70 a. d.) and before their major migrations to regions of poland and russia (before 1100 a. d.).  
8533757	novel inherited mutations and variable expressivity of brca1 alleles, including the founder mutation 185delag in ashkenazi jewish families. thirty-seven families with four or more cases of OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 or breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 were analyzed for mutations in brca1. twelve different germ-line mutations, four novel and eight previously observed, were detected in 16 families. five families of ashkenazi jewish descent carried the 185delag mutation and shared the same haplotype at eight polymorphic markers spanning approximately 850 kb at brca1. expressivity of 185delag in these families varied, from early-onset OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 without OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. mutation 4184deltcaa occurred independently in two families. in one family, penetrance was complete, with females developing early-onset OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 and the male carrier developing DOID10283OMIM176807OMIM607592MESHD011471, whereas, in the other family, penetrance was incomplete and only OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 occurred, diagnosed at ages 38-81 years. two novel nonsense mutations led to the loss of mutant brca1 transcript in families with 10 and 6 cases of early-onset OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. a 665-nt segment of the brca1 3-utr and 1. 3 kb of genomic sequence including the putative promoter region were invariant by single-strand conformation analysis in 13 families without coding-sequence mutations. overall in our series, brca1 mutations have been detected in 26 families  16 with positive brca1 lod scores, 7 with negative lod scores (reflecting multiple sporadic breast DOID162MESHD009369), and 3 not tested for linkage. three other families have positive lod scores for linkage to brca2, but 13 families without detected brca1 mutations have negative lod scores for both brca1 and brca2. 
10767343	transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences with expanded ctg repeat mimic closely the dm ctg repeat intergenerational and somatic instability. OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) is caused by a ctg repeat expansion in the 3utr of the dm protein kinase (dmpk) gene. a very high level of instability is observed through successive generations and the size of the repeat is generally correlated with the severity of the DOID4MESHD004194 and with age at onset. furthermore, tissues from dm patients exhibit somatic mosaicism that increases with age. we generated transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences with 20, 55 or > 300 ctg, cloned from patients from the same affected dm family. using large human flanking sequences and a large amplification, we demonstrate that the intergenerational ctg repeat instability is reproduced in mice, with a strong bias towards expansions and with the same sex- and size-dependent characteristics as in humans. moreover, a high level of instability, increasing with age, can be observed in tissues and in sperm. although we did not observe dramatic expansions (or big jumps over several hundred ctg repeats) as in congenital forms of dm, our model carrying > 300 ctg is the first to show instability so close to the human dm situation. our three models carrying different sizes of ctg repeat provide insight on the different factors modulating the ctg repeat instability.. 
133535	linkage of gene for OMIM217000DOID0060295 and the major histocompatibility complex mhc in man. family study of a further case. close linkage between hl-a and OMIM217000DOID0060295 was first reported by fu and co-workers in 1974. we present here a pedigree of a 31-year-old c2-deficient individual with clinical manifestations of DOID8543DOID8628DOID8654OMIM236000MESHD006689. the following markers were tested  c2 levels, factor b polymorphism, blood groups, and enzyme typing. in addition to close linkage between hl-a and OMIM217000DOID0060295, both parents were heterozygous for bf (hl-a linked, electrophoretic variation of b). the two hl-a haplotypes closely linked to OMIM217000DOID0060295 are different  2, w18 and w24, w18. they share, however, the sd2 antigen w18 and the ld type 7a.. 
10051007	age of onset in OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 : sex specific influence of apolipoprotein e genotype and normal cag repeat length. age of onset (ao) of OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 (hd) is known to be correlated with the length of an expanded cag repeat in the hd gene. apolipoprotein e (apoe) genotype, in turn, is known to influence ao in alzheimer DOID4MESHD004194, rendering the apoe gene a likely candidate to affect ao in other neurological DOID4MESHD004194MESHC too. we therefore determined apoe genotype and normal cag repeat length in the hd gene for 138 hd patients who were previously analysed with respect to cag repeat length. genotyping for apoe was performed blind to clinical information. in addition to highlighting the effect of the normal repeat length upon ao in maternally inherited hd and in male patients, we show that the apoe epsilon2epsilon3 genotype is associated with significantly earlier ao in males than in females. such a sex difference in ao was not apparent for any of the other apoe genotypes. our findings suggest that subtle differences in the course of the neurodegeneration  in hd  may allow interacting genes to exert gender specific effects upon ao.
1978564	genetic linkage map of six polymorphic dna markers around the gene for DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 on chromosome 5. a genetic linkage map of six polymorphic dna markers close to the gene (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125) for DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM105210) on chromosome 5q is reported. one hundred fifty-five typed members of nine OMIM105210 kindred provided more than 90 meioses for linkage analysis. a number of crucial recombination events have been identified which are informative at three or more loci, allowing confident ordering of parts of the map. there was no evidence of genetic heterogeneity, with all families showing linkage of at least one chromosome 5 marker to the gene. recombination data and two-point linkage analysis support a locus order of centromere-pi 227-c11p11-ecb27-l5. 62-OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125-ef5 62-OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125-ef5. 44-yn5 44-yn5. 48-telomer e, although ef5. 44 could lie in the interval l5. 62-OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 or ecb27-l5. 62. no recombinants were identified between OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 and either ef5. 44 or yn5. 48, but published deletion mapping in DOID9256OMIM114500OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 and linkage analysis in OMIM105210 suggest that yn5. 48 is 1-3 cm from OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125. the present study suggests that yn5. 48 and l5. 62 delineate a small region of chromosome 5 within which the ef5. 44 locus lies very close to the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene. these data not only allow use of flanking markers for presymptomatic diagnosis of OMIM105210 but also provide a high-density map of the region for isolation of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene itself and for further assessment of the role of chromosome 5 deletions in the biology of sporadic OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179.
8370681	detection of a novel arginine vasopressin OMIM188560 by dideoxy fingerprinting. OMIM178110MESHC566739 neurohypophyseal DOID9409MESHD003919 is a familial form of DOID9409MESHD003919. this disorder is associated with variable levels of arginine vasopressin (avp) and DOID9409MESHD003919 of varying severity, which responds to exogenous avp. to determine the molecular basis of OMIM178110MESHC566739 neurohypophyseal DOID9409MESHD003919, the avp genes of members of a large kindred were analyzed. a new method, called dideoxy fingerprinting, was used to detect an avp mutation that was characterized by dna sequencing. the novel OMIM188560 found changes the last codon of the avp signal peptide from alanine to threonine, which should perturb cleavage of mature avp from its precursor protein and inhibit its secretion or action..

2703233	OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 is closely linked to the gene for muscle-type creatine kinase (ckmm). we have studied genetic linkage between the gene for creatine kinase muscle type (ckmm) and the gene for OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm). in a panel of 65 OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 families from canada and the netherlands, a maximum lod score (zmax) of 22. 8 at a recombination frequency (theta) of 0. 03 was obtained. tight linkage was also demonstrated for ckmm and the gene for apolipoprotein c2 (apoc2). this establishes ckmm as a useful marker for OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223

10554035	constitutional von hippel-lindau (OMIM193300) gene deletions detected in OMIM193300 families by fluorescence in situ hybridization. von hippel-lindau (OMIM193300) DOID4MESHD004194 is an autosomal dominantly inherited DOID162MESHD009369 DOID225MESHD013577 predisposing to a variety of DOID162MESHD009369 types that include retinal DOID5241MESHD018325, DOID5241MESHD018325 of the central nervous system, DOID4450DOID4464DOID4465DOID4467DOID4471DOID4473OMIM144700OMIM300854OMIM605074MESHD002292, MESHD010181 and DOID162MESHD009369, DOID0050771OMIM171300MESHD010673, endolymphatic sac DOID162MESHD009369, and epididymal DOID2634MESHD003537 [w. m. linehan et al., j. am. med. assoc., 273  564-570, 1995; e. a. maher and w. g. kaelin, jr., medicine (baltimore), 76  381-391, 1997; w. m. linehan and r. d. klausner, in  b. vogelstein and k. kinzler (eds.), the genetic basis of human DOID162MESHD009369, pp. 455-473, mcgraw-hill, 1998]. the OMIM193300 gene was localized to chromosome 3p25-26 and cloned [f. latif et al., science (washington dc), 260  1317-1320, 1993]. germline mutations in the OMIM193300 gene have been detected in the majority of OMIM193300 kindreds. the reported frequency of detection of OMIM193300 germline mutations has varied from 39 to 80% (j. m. whaley et al., am. j. hum. genet., 55  1092-1102, 1994; clinical research group for japan, hum. mol. genet., 4  2233-2237, 1995; f. chen et al., hum. mutat., 5  66-75, 1995; e. r. maher et al., j. med. genet., 33  328-332, 1996; b. zbar, DOID162MESHD009369 surv., 25  219-232, 1995). recently a quantitative southern blotting procedure was found to improve this frequency (c. stolle et al., hum. mutat., 12  417-423, 1998). in the present study, we report the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) as a method to detect and characterize OMIM193300 germline deletions. we reexamined a group of OMIM193300 patients shown previously by single-strand conformation and sequencing analysis not to harbor point mutations in the OMIM193300 locus. we found constitutional deletions in 29 of 30 OMIM193300 patients in this group using cosmid and p1 probes that cover the OMIM193300 locus. we then tested six phenotypically normal offspring from four of these OMIM193300 families  two were found to carry the deletion and the other four were deletion-free. in addition, germline mosaicism of the OMIM193300 gene was identified in one family. in sum, fish was found to be a simple and reliable method to detect OMIM193300 germline deletions and practically useful in cases where other methods of screening have failed to detect a OMIM193300 gene abnormality 
7481765	aberrant subcellular localization of brca1 in OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943. the brca1 gene product was identified as a 220-kilodalton nuclear phosphoprotein in normal cells, including breast ductal epithelial cells, and in 18 of 20 DOID162MESHD009369 cell lines derived from tissues other than breast and ovary. in 16 of 17 breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 lines and 17 of 17 samples of cells obtained from malignant effusions, however, brca1 localized mainly in cytoplasm. absence of brca1 or aberrant subcellular location was also observed to a variable extent in histological sections of many OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 biopsies. these findings suggest that brca1 abnormalities may be involved in the pathogenesis of many breast DOID162MESHD009369, sporadic as well as familial.. 
107868	hla b27 and the genetics of ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166. one hundred and twenty-eight of 145 patients with ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166 (as) were found to be hla b27 positive. five patients had evidence of a sero-negative peripheral DOID848MESHD001168 resembling peripheral DOID9008OMIM607507MESHD015535 and 3 of these were b27 negative. one further b27 negative patients had a sister with ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166 and DOID8577OMIM191390MESHD003093 and a mother with DOID8577OMIM191390MESHD003093. there was evidence of a somewhat later age of onset of symptoms in b27 negative patients. these findings are interpreted as suggesting some degree of clinical and genetic heterogeneity in ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166 with genes for DOID8893DOID4398OMIM177900OMIM601454OMIM602723OMIM603935OMIM604316OMIM605364OMIM605606OMIM607857OMIM610707OMIM612410OMIM612599OMIM612950OMIM614070OMIM614204OMIM616106MESHD011565 and DOID0050589OMIM266600MESHD015212 being important in some individuals, particularly those who are b27 negative. twenty-five first-degree relatives with ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166 were all b27 positive. the only instance of disassociation of b27 and DOID6590MESHD013166 in a family was where the proband had DOID8577OMIM191390MESHD003093 as well as DOID6590MESHD013166. of 13 b27 positive fathers 3 could be diagnosed as having definite ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166 (23%). these findings are thought to provide evidence against the concept that the gene for ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166 is not b27 but a closely linked gene and favour the occurrence of an environmental event affecting approximately one-fifth of b27 positive males to result in DOID4MESHD004194.. 
7858169	late infantile OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 in israel. OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 (OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966) is a DOID1289MESHD019636 in which the lysosomal enzyme, aryl sulfatase a (arsa) is deficient. the DOID4MESHD004194 is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and its frequency is estimated to be 1/40, 000 live births. the gene of arsa has been cloned and up to now eight mutations causing OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 have been reported. another mutation, pd, leads to the deficiency of the enzyme in vitro (pseudodeficiency) without any known clinical effect. the pd mutation is frequent in all populations. in israel, late infantile OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 was found to be very frequent in a small jewish isolate, the habbanite jews (1/75 live births). the molecular analysis demonstrated that in the habbanite population, the mutation occurred on an allele with the pd mutation. the loss of arsa activity is due to a point mutation c > t leading to a change of proline to leucine. OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 is also frequent among moslem arabs in jerusalem. the mutation is a transition g > a destroying the splice donor site of exon 2. this mutation has been reported in patients with the late infantile OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 from different ethnic groups. the christian arabs in israel also have a high incidence of the DOID4MESHD004194 (1/10, 000 live births); the mutation in this population is still unknown. knowledge of the different mutations causing OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 in these defined populations will allow a carrier screening program to be carried out and prevent the birth of additional affected children.. 
10982189	genomic rearrangements of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 DOID162MESHD009369-suppressor gene in DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125. germline mutations of the DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125) DOID162MESHD009369-suppressor gene result in the hereditary OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 DOID225MESHD013577 DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM105210). almost all OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutations that have been identified are single-nucleotide alterations, small insertions, or small deletions that would truncate the protein product of the gene. no well-characterized intragenic rearrangement of OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 has been described, and the prevalence of this type of mutation in OMIM105210 patients is not clear. we screened 49 potential OMIM105210 families and identified 26 different germline OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutations in 30 families. four of these mutations were genomic rearrangements resulting from homologous and nonhomologous recombinations mediated by alu elements. two of these four rearrangements were complex, involving deletion and insertion of nucleotides. of these four rearrangements, one resulted in the deletion of exons 11 and 12 and two others resulted in either complete or partial deletion of exon 14. the fourth rearrangement grossly altered the sequence within intron 14. although this rearrangement did not affect any coding sequence of OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 at the genomic dna level, it caused inappropriate splicing of exon 14. these rearrangements were initially revealed by analyzing cdnas and could not have been identified by using mutation detection methods that screened each exon individually. the identification of a rearrangement that did not alter any coding exons yet affected the splicing further underscores the importance of using cdna for mutation analysis. the identification of four genomic rearrangements among 30 mutations suggests that genomic rearrangements are frequent germline OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutations.. 
8075631	familial DOID1614MESHD018567 is not linked to the brca1 locus on chromosome 17q. OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 in men is about a hundredfold less common than in women and this has hindered research into its genetic basis. we have examined 22 families with at least one case of DOID1614MESHD018567 for linkage to the hereditary breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 locus, brca1, on chromosome 17q. we found strong evidence against linkage to brca1 (lod score-16. 63) and the best estimate of the proportion of linked families was 0% (95% ci 0-18%). our results indicate that there is a gene (s) other than brca1 which predisposes to early-onset OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 in women and which confers a higher risk of DOID1614MESHD018567. identification of additional pedigrees that include cases of DOID1614MESHD018567 may therefore facilitate the mapping and isolation of this gene. 
8528200	evidence for inter-generational instability in the cag repeat in the mjd1 gene and for conserved haplotypes at flanking markers amongst japanese and caucasian subjects with OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827. the size of the (cag)n repeat array in the 3' end of the mjd1 gene and the haplotype at a series of microsatellite markers surrounding the mjd1 gene were examined in a large cohort of japanese and caucasian subjects affected with OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 (OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827). our data provide five novel observations. first, OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 is associated with expansion fo the array from the normal range of 14-37 repeats to 68-84 repeats in most japanese and caucasian subjects, but no subjects were observed with expansions intermediate in size between those of the normal and OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 affected groups. second, the expanded allele associated with OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 displays inter-generational instability, particularly in male meioses, and this instability was associated with the clinical phenomenon of anticipation. third, the size of the expanded allele is not only inversely correlated with the age-of-onset of OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 (r = -0.738, p < 0.001), but is also correlated with the frequency of other clinical features [e.g. pseudoexophthalmos and pyramidal signs were more frequent in subjects with large repeats (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 respectively)]. fourth, the DOID4MESHD004194 phenotype is significantly more severe and had an early age of onset (16 years) in a subject homozygous for the expanded allele, which contrasts with OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 and suggests that the expanded allele in the mjd1 gene could exert its effect either by a dominant negative effect (putatively excluded in hd) or by a gain of function effect as proposed for hd. finally, japanese and caucasian subjects affected with OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 share haplotypes at several markers surrounding the mjd1 gene, which are uncommon in the normal japanese and caucasian population, and which suggests the existence either of common founders in these populations or of chromosomes susceptible to pathologic expansion of the cag repeat in the mjd1 gene.
3674116	familial OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 with apparently normal chromosomes. we report on 4 sibs (2f, 2m) with OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218). diagnosis was made clinically on the basis of history, behavior, and physical findings in 3 of the sibs. the other child had died at age 10 months with a history and clinical findings typical of first phase of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. results of chromosome studies on the parents and surviving sibs were normal. the implications of this unusual familial occurrence for our understanding of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 are discussed.. 
7759075	age at diagnosis as an indicator of eligibility for brca1 dna testing in familial OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943. we searched for criteria that could indicate OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 families with a high prior probability of being caused by the breast/OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 susceptibility locus brca1 on chromosome 17. to this end, we performed a linkage study with 59 consecutively collected dutch OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 families, including 16 with at least one case of OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. we used an intake cut-off of at least three first-degree relatives with breast and/or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 at any age. significant evidence for linkage was found only among the 13 OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 families with a mean age at diagnosis of less than 45 years. an unexpectedly low proportion of the breast-OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 families were estimated to be linked to brca1, which could be due to a founder effect in the dutch population. given the expected logistical problems in clinical management now that brca1 has been identified, we propose an interim period in which only families with a strong positive family history for early onset breast and/or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 will be offered brca1 mutation testing.. 
1999339	some mexican glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants revisited. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency appears to be fairly common in mexico. we have now examined the dna of three previously reported electrophoretically fast mexican g6pd variants, -g6pd distrito federal, g6pd tepic, and g6pd castilla. all three of these variants, believed on the basis of biochemical characterization and population origin to be unique, have the g----a transition at nucleotide 202 and the a----g transition at nucleotide 376, mutations that we now recognize to be characteristic of g6pd a-. two other mexican males with DOID2862MESHD005955 were found to have the same mutation. all five have the (nlaiii/foki/pvuii/psti) haplotype characteristic of g6pd a -in africa. since the pvuii + genotype seems to be rare in europe, we conclude that all of these g6pd a - genes had their ancient origin in africa, although in many of the mexican patients with g6pd a -202a/376g the gene may have been imported more recently from spain, where this variant, formerly known as g6pd betica, is also prevalent.. 
10924409	inactivation of germline mutant OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 alleles by attenuated somatic mutations: a molecular genetic mechanism for attenuated DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125. germline mutations of the DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125) DOID162MESHD009369-suppressor gene result in DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM105210). patients with OMIM105210 typically develop hundreds to thousands of benign DOID9256OMIM114500OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 and early-onset OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179. a subset of germline OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutations results in an attenuated OMIM105210 (afap) phenotype, in which patients develop fewer DOID162MESHD009369 and develop them at an older age. although a genotype-phenotype correlation between the locations of OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 germline mutations and the development of afap has been well documented, the mechanism for afap has not been well defined. we investigated the mechanism for afap in patients carrying a mutant OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 allele (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (as9)) that has a mutation in the alternatively spliced region of exon 9. OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (as9) was found to down-regulate beta-catenin-regulated transcription, the major DOID162MESHD009369-suppressor function of OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125, as did the wild-type OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125. mutation analysis showed that both OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (as9) and the wild-type OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 alleles were somatically mutated in most DOID9256OMIM114500OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 from these patients. functional analysis showed that 4666insa, a common somatic mutation in OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (as9) in these DOID162MESHD009369, did not inactivate the wild-type OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125. our results indicate that carriers of OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (as9) develop fewer DOID9256OMIM114500OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 than do typical patients with OMIM105210 because somatic inactivation of both OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 alleles is necessary for colorectal MESHD063646. however, these patients develop DOID9256OMIM114500OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 more frequently than does the general population because OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (as9) is inactivated by mutations that do not inactivate the wild-type OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125.. 
1334370	submicroscopic deletions at the OMIM194072DOID14515MESHD017624 locus, revealed by nonradioactive in situ hybridization. fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) with biotin-labeled probes mapping to 11p13 has been used for the molecular analysis of deletions of the OMIM194072DOID14515MESHD017624 (wilms DOID162MESHD009369, DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783, MESHD014564, and DOID1059MESHD008607) locus. we have detected a submicroscopic 11p13 deletion in a child with inherited DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 who subsequently presented with wilms DOID162MESHD009369 in a MESHD000069337, only revealed at surgery. the mother, who has DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783, was also found to carry a deletion including both the DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 candidate gene (OMIM617141DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617142MESHD015783) and the wilms DOID162MESHD009369 predisposition gene (OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396). this is therefore a rare case of an inherited OMIM194072DOID14515MESHD017624 deletion. wilms DOID162MESHD009369 has so far only been associated with sporadic de novo DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 cases. we have shown that a cosmid probe for a candidate DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 gene, homologous to the mouse pax-6 gene, is deleted in cell lines from DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 patients with previously characterized deletions at 11p13, while another cosmid marker mapping between two DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783-associated translocation breakpoints (and hence a second candidate marker) is present on both chromosomes. these results support the pax-6 homologue as a strong candidate for the OMIM617141DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617142MESHD015783 gene. fish with cosmid probes has proved to be a fast and reliable technique for the molecular analysis of deletions. it can be used with limited amounts of material and has strong potential for clinical applications.. 
8279472	haplotype studies in OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527. in 51 families with OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527, we have studied dna haplotypes of dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms (ca repeats) in the 13q14. 3 region, to examine these markers for association with the OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527 gene (OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527). in addition to a marker (d13s133) described elsewhere, we have developed three new highly polymorphic markers (d13s314, d13s315, and d13s316) close to the OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527 locus. we have examined the distribution of marker alleles at the loci studied and have found that d13s314, d13s133, and d13s316 each show nonrandom distribution on chromosomes carrying the OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527 mutation. we have studied haplotypes of these three markers and have found that there are highly significant differences between OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527 and normal haplotypes in northern european families. these findings have important implications for mutation detection and molecular diagnosis in families with OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527. 
10541953	growth hormone treatment increases co(2) response, ventilation and central inspiratory drive in children with OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. we studied whether the beneficial effects of growth hormone (gh) treatment on growth and body composition in OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 are accompanied by an improvement in respiratory function. we measured resting ventilation, airway occlusion pressure (p (0. 1)) and ventilatory response to co (2) in nine children, aged 7-14 years, before and 6-9 months after the start of gh treatment. during gh treatment, resting ventilation increased by 26%, p (0. 1) by 72% and the response to co (2) by 65% (p < 0. 002, < 0. 04 and < 0. 02, respectively). this observed increase in ventilatory output was not correlated to changes in OMIM606641. conclusion  treatment of children with OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218) seems to have a stimulatory effect on central respiratory structures. the observed increase in ventilation and inspiratory drive may contribute to the improved activity level reported by parents of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 children during growth hormone therapy 
8522307	somatic von hippel-lindau mutation in clear cell papillary DOID2634MESHD003537 of the epididymis. papillary DOID2634MESHD003537 of the epididymis is an uncommon benign lesion that may occur sporadically or as a manifestation of von hippel-lindau (OMIM193300) DOID4MESHD004194. neither immunohistochemical studies nor molecular genetic analyses of the OMIM193300 gene have been reported previously for this lesion. the authors describe two cases of clear cell papillary DOID2634MESHD003537 of the epididymis, both of which were initially confused with metastatic DOID4450DOID4464DOID4465DOID4467DOID4471DOID4473OMIM144700OMIM300854OMIM605074MESHD002292. both lesions showed positive immunohistochemical staining for low and intermediate molecular weight keratins (OMIM116800OMIM116860MESHC535342MESHD020786 5. 2 and ae1/ae3), OMIM231680, vimentin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin. each was negative for cea. because clear cell papillary DOID2634MESHD003537 is similar to DOID4450DOID4464DOID4465DOID4467DOID4471DOID4473OMIM144700OMIM300854OMIM605074MESHD002292 histologically, and because both occur as components of the von DOID14175OMIM193300MESHD006623 complex, the authors analyzed both cases for the presence of mutations in the OMIM193300 gene. a somatic OMIM193300 gene mutation was detected in one of the two DOID162MESHD009369 by polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. direct sequencing revealed a cytosine to thymine transition at nucleotide 694, resulting in the replacement of an arginine with a stop codon after the sixth amino acid of exon 3. as the OMIM193300 gene is believed to function as a DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor gene, OMIM193300 gene mutations may play a role in the initiation of MESHD063646 in sporadic DOID2634MESHD003537 of the epididymis. 
7825586	an evaluation of genetic heterogeneity in 145 breast-OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 families. OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 linkage consortium. the breast-DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051-family DOID225MESHD013577 is a dominant predisposition to DOID1612DOID3459OMIM114480MESHD001943 and ovaries which has been mapped to chromosome region 17q12-q21. the majority, but not all, of breast-DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051 families show linkage to this susceptibility locus, designated brca1. we report here the results of a linkage analysis of 145 families with both breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. these families contain either a total of three or more cases of early-onset (before age 60 years) OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. all families contained at least one case of OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. overall, an estimated 76% of the 145 families are linked to the brca1 locus. none of the 13 families with cases of DOID1614MESHD018567 appear to be linked, but it is estimated that 92% (95% confidence interval 76% -100%) of families with no DOID1614MESHD018567 and with two or more DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051 are linked to brca1. these data suggest that the breast-OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051-family DOID225MESHD013577 is genetically heterogeneous. however, the large majority of families with early-onset OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 and with two or more cases of OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 are likely to be due to brca1 mutations.. 
4019732	genetic analysis in families with DOID0060239OMIM119300MESHC536528. we have brought together information on 864 affected individuals in 164 families (including three new pedigrees) reported in the 137 year period since 1845 when demarquay first described a family with what was later called DOID0060239OMIM119300MESHC536528 (vws). both types of oral cleft, OMIM119540DOID674MESHD002972MESHC566991 (cp) and DOID9296MESHD002971 with or without cp (clp), segregate in these families together with lower OMIM247610 pits or fistulae in an OMIM178110MESHC566739 mode with high penetrance estimated to be k =. 89 and. 99 by different methods. cleft types (clp and cp) occur in vws in the same proportions as in the general non-vws population, ie, about twice as many cleft-bearing individuals have clp as have cp. on the other hand, we do not find the usually observed excess of females with cp and excess of males with clp; in vws the sex ratios are more nearly equal. OMIM247610 pits also are equally distributed between the sexes. affected males and females are equally likely to transmit vws. however, there is an excess of less severely affected individuals among transmitters and a deficiency of more severely affected, brought about by a proband bias and differential fecundity. the expression of vws is significantly modified by the genetic background  more extreme phenotypes in parents tend to produce more extreme expression in their children. for a vws gene carrier the relative risk of transmitting a cleft is 26. 45%; that of transmitting lower OMIM247610 pits is 23. 55%. three pedigrees of OMIM247610 pits in the literature show no clefts among a significant number of affected individuals. control of gene expression in vws in the three target tissues appears to be independent and separately designated. mutation rate of the vws gene is calculated to be 1. 8 x 10 (-5) 
2491010	molecular and phenotypic analysis of patients with deletions within the deletion-rich region of the duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) gene. eighty unrelated individuals with duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388)or becker DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826) were found to have deletions in the major deletion-rich region of the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 locus. this region includes the last five exons detected by cdna5b-7, all exons detected by cdna8, and the first two exons detected by cdna9. these 80 individuals account for approximately 75% of 109 deletions of the gene, detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cdna. endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (dxs269; wapenaar et al.) and gmgx11 (dxs239; present paper). clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype. thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388, OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826, or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron/exon boundaries. of these, eight OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826 patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact, while 21 OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 patients, 7 intermediate patients, and 1 OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826 patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame. thus, with two exceptions, frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions. this is in agreement with recent findings by baumbach et al. and koenig et al. but is in contrast to findings, by malhotra et al. at the 5 ' end of the gene.
10417279	proteolipoprotein gene analysis in 82 patients with sporadic pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194: duplications, the major cause of the DOID4MESHD004194, originate more frequently in male germ cells, but point mutations do not. the clinical european network on brain dysmyelinating DOID4MESHD004194. pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 (OMIM312080OMIM601186DOID3210OMIM169500MESHD020371) is an x-linked developmental OMIM188560 of myelination affecting the central nervous system and segregating with the proteolipoprotein (plp) locus. investigating 82 strictly selected sporadic cases of OMIM312080OMIM601186DOID3210OMIM169500MESHD020371, we found plp mutations in 77%; complete plp-gene duplications were the most frequent abnormality (62%), whereas point mutations in coding or splice-site regions of the gene were involved less frequently (38%). we analyzed the maternal status of 56 cases to determine the origin of both types of plp mutation, since this is relevant to genetic counseling. in the 22 point mutations, 68% of mothers were heterozygous for the mutation, a value identical to the two-thirds of carrier mothers that would be expected if there were an equal mutation rate in male and female germ cells. in sharp contrast, among the 34 duplicated cases, 91% of mothers were carriers, a value significantly (chi2 = 9. 20, p <. 01) in favor of a male bias, with an estimation of the male/female mutation frequency (k) of 9. 3 3. moreover, we observed the occurrence of de novo mutations between parental and grandparental generations in 17 three-generation families, which allowed a direct estimation of the k value (k = 11). again, a significant male mutation imbalance was observed only for the duplications. 
2569949	haplotype analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in turkish OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 families. we have estimated the haplotype distribution of mutant and normal phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600) alleles for 17 turkish OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 (OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661) families  20 normal and 27 mutated OMIM178600 alleles could be identified. of the latter, the most prevalent were associated with haplotype 6 (29. 6%), 1 (18. 5%) and 36 (11. 1%), while the normal alleles were preferentially associated with haplotype 1 (20%). of the 19 different haplotypes observed, 5 have not been described previously. the haplotype distribution differed significantly from that of the northern european population. two of the eight polymorphic sites were in association with OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661. no deletions of exon sequences were found in the families analysed.
7668252	cloning of human very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase and molecular characterization of its deficiency in two patients. two overlapping cdna clones (1, 991 bp and 736 bp, respectively) encoding the precursor of human mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase (vlcad) were cloned and sequenced. the cdna inserts of these clones together encompass a region of 2, 177 bases, encoding the entire protein of 655 amino acids, including a 40-amino acid leader peptide and a 615-amino acid mature polypeptide. pcr-amplified vlcad cdnas were sequenced in cultured fibroblasts from two vlcad-deficient patients. in both patients, a 105-bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182 in vlcad cdna was identified. the deletion seems to occur due to exon skipping during processing of vlcad pre-mrna. this is the first demonstration of a mutation causing OMIM201475MESHC536353. quantitative cdna expression of normal human vlcad was performed in the patients fibroblasts, using DOID3298MESHD014615 viral system, which demonstrated that the deficiency of the normal vlcad protein causes impaired long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation activity in the patients fibroblasts. in patient fibroblasts, raising vlcad activity to approximately 20% of normal control fibroblast activity raised palmitic acid beta-oxidation flux to the level found in control fibroblasts, which may offer important information for the rational design of future somatic gene therapy for OMIM201475MESHC536353..

3615198	gt to at transition at a splice donor site causes skipping of the preceding exon in OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661. classical OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 (OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661) is an autosomal recessive human DOID630MESHD030342 caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600). we isolated several mutant OMIM178600 cdna clones from a OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 carrier individual and showed that they contained an internal 116 base pair deletion, corresponding precisely to exon 12 of the human chromosomal OMIM178600 gene. the deletion causes the synthesis of a truncated protein lacking the c-terminal 52 amino acids. gene transfer and expression studies using the mutant OMIM178600 cdna indicated that the deletion abolishes OMIM178600 activity in the cell as a result of protein instability. to determine the molecular basis of the deletion, the mutant chromosomal OMIM178600 gene was isolated from this individual and shown to contain a gt-- greater than at substitution at the 5 splice donor site of intron 12. thus, the consequence of the splice donor site mutation in the human liver is the skipping of the preceding exon during rna splicing.. 
10521293	clinical and molecular genetic analysis of 19 wolfram DOID225MESHD013577 kindreds demonstrating a wide spectrum of mutations in OMIM222300DOID0110629DOID10632MESHD014929. wolfram DOID225MESHD013577 is an autosomal recessive DOID1289MESHD019636 characterized by juvenile-onset DOID9351MESHD003920 and progressive optic MESHD001284. mtdna deletions have been described, and a gene (OMIM222300DOID0110629DOID10632MESHD014929) recently has been identified, on chromosome 4p16, encoding a predicted 890 amino acid transmembrane protein. direct dna sequencing was done to screen the entire coding region of the OMIM222300DOID0110629DOID10632MESHD014929 gene in 30 patients from 19 british kindreds with wolfram DOID225MESHD013577. dna was also screened for structural rearrangements (deletions and duplications) and point mutations in mtdna. no pathogenic mtdna mutations were found in our cohort. we identified 24 mutations in the OMIM222300DOID0110629DOID10632MESHD014929 gene  8 nonsense mutations, 8 missense mutations, 3 in-frame deletions, 1 in-frame insertion, and 4 frameshift mutations. of these, 23 were novel mutations, and most occurred in exon 8. the majority of patients were compound heterozygotes for two mutations, and there was no common founder mutation. the data were also analyzed for genotype-phenotype relationships. although some interesting cases were noted, consideration of the small sample size and frequency of each mutation indicated no clear-cut correlations between any of the observed mutations and DOID4MESHD004194 severity. there were no obvious mutation hot spots or clusters. hence, molecular screening for wolfram DOID225MESHD013577 in affected families and for wolfram DOID225MESHD013577-carrier status in subjects with DOID150MESHD001523 or DOID9351MESHD003920 will require complete analysis of exon 8 and upstream exons.. 
10528860	maternal MESHD024182 for chromosome 14 in a boy with a normal karyotype. we report on a boy with a maternal MESHD024182 for chromosome 14 (upd (14)). at 7 years of age he was referred to us by the paediatrician because of symptoms of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218). he showed short OMIM475000, OMIM601665OMIM618406DOID9970MESHD009765, mild developmental delay, DOID11383OMIM219050MESHD003456, and some mild dysmorphic features. the history further indicated MESHD005317 at the end of the pregnancy. his mother was 44 years of age at the time of his birth. after birth he showed MESHD009123 with poor sucking, for which gavage feeding was needed. motor development was delayed. after 1 year he became obese despite a normal appetite. recurrent middle MESHD010031, a high MESHD010146 threshold, and a great skill with jigsaw puzzles were reported. there were no behavioural problems or sleep disturbance. chromosomal analysis was normal (46, xy). dna analysis for OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 showed no abnormalities. two years later he was re-examined because we thought his features fitted the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218-like phenotype associated with maternal upd (14). at that time DOID0111545OMIM176400OMIM615346MESHD011629 was evident. dna analysis showed maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 14. in all the previously described 11 cases with maternal upd (14), a robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 was detected cytogenetically before dna analysis. this is the first report of diagnosis of maternal upd (14) based on clinical features. this finding underlines the importance of dna analysis for maternal upd (14) in patients with a similar OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218-like phenotype even without previous identification of a robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14.. 
7611277	detection of eight brca1 mutations in 10 breast/OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 families, including 1 family with DOID1614MESHD018567. genetic epidemiological evidence suggests that mutations in brca1 may be responsible for approximately one half of early onset familial OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 and the majority of familial breast/OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. the recent cloning of brca1 allows for the direct detection of mutations, but the feasibility of presymptomatic screening for DOID162MESHD009369 susceptibility is unknown. we analyzed genomic dna from one affected individual from each of 24 families with at least three cases of ovarian or OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943, using sscp assays. variant sscp bands were subcloned and sequenced. allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to verify sequence changes and to screen dna from control individuals. six frameshift and two missense mutations were detected in 10 different families. a frameshift mutation was detected in a male proband affected with both breast and OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471. a 40-bp deletion was detected in a patient who developed intra-abdominal DOID305DOID4015MESHD002277 1 year after prophylactic oophorectomy. mutations were detected throughout the gene, and only one was detected in more than a single family. these results provide further evidence that inherited breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 can occur as a consequence of a wide array of brca1 mutations. these results suggests that development of a screening test for brca1 mutations will be technically challenging. the finding of a mutation in a family with DOID1614MESHD018567, not previously thought to be related to brca1, also illustrates the potential difficulties of genetic counseling for individuals known to carry mutations.. 
2729274	DOID11661DOID13399DOID13909DOID13910DOID13911DOID13912MESHD003117 in OMIM300100MESHD000326. the relationship between abnormal color vision and OMIM300100MESHD000326 (amn) was investigated in 27 amn patients and 31 age-matched controls by using the farnsworth-munsell 100 hue test. twelve (44%) of 27 patients showed test scores significantly above normal. the axes of bipolarity determined by the testing differed widely between the patients with abnormal scores, compatible with the notion that different alterations in visual pigment genes occur in different amn kindreds. these observations confirm our earlier impression that the frequency of abnormal color vision is increased in these kindreds, and it supports our contentions that (1) amn (and its companion, OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326) are very closely linked to the visual pigment loci at xq28 and (2) this proximity might provide the opportunity to observe contiguous gene defects.. 
3169738	patterns of exon deletions in duchenne and becker DOID9884MESHD009136. a panel of patients with duchenne and becker DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 and OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826) has been screened with the cdna probes cf56a and cf23a, which detect exons in the central part of the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene. one or more exons were deleted in 60% of patients. the deletions were mapped and prove to be heterogeneous in size and extent, particularly in OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388. deletions specific to OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 and to OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826 are described. half of all OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826 patients have a deletion of one particular small group of exons; smaller deletions within this same group produce the more severe OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388.. 
7951327	the lec rat has a deletion in the copper transporting atpase gene homologous to the OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527 gene. the long-evans cinnamon (lec) rat shows similarity to OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527 in many clinical and biochemical features. we have cloned cdnas for the rat gene (atp7b) homologous to the human OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527 gene (atp7b) and have used them to identify a partial deletion in the atp7b gene in the lec rat. the deletion removes at least 900 bp of the coding region at the 3 end, includes the crucial atp binding domain and extends downstream of the gene. our results provide convincing evidence for defining the lec rat as an animal model for OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527. this model will be important for studying liver pathophysiology, for developing therapy for OMIM277900DOID893MESHD006527 and for studying the pathway of copper transport and its possible interaction with other heavy metals.. 
8440142	detection of a new submicroscopic OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 deletion interval with a novel dna probe isolated by differential alu pcr fingerprint cloning. differential alu pcr fingerprint cloning was used to isolate a dna probe from the xp11. 4-- > p11. 21 region of the human x chromosome. this novel sequence, cpxr318 (dxs742), detects a new submicroscopic deletion interval at the OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 locus (ndp). combining our data with the consensus genetic map of the proximal short arm of the x chromosome, we propose the physical order xcen-dxs14-dxs255- (dxs426, timp) - (dxs742- ([maob-maoa-dxs7], ndp) -dxs77-dxs228) -dxs209-dxs148-dxs196- + + + xpter. the cpxr318 probe and a subclone from a cosmid corresponding to the dxs7 locus were converted into sequence-tagged sites. finally, dxs742, dsx7, dxs77, and maoa were integrated into a physical map spanning the OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 locus 
1731805	genetic analysis of a japanese family with normotriglyceridemic OMIM200100DOID1386MESHD000012 indicates a lack of linkage to the apolipoprotein b gene. normotriglyceridemic OMIM200100DOID1386MESHD000012 is a rare familial disorder characterized by an isolated deficiency of apob-100. we have previously reported a patient with this DOID4MESHD004194, who had normal apob-48 but no apob-100. to elucidate the genetic abnormalities in this family, we studied the linkage of apob gene using three genetic markers. the proband and her affected brother showed completely different apob gene alleles, suggesting that the apob gene itself is not related to this disorder in this family. by contrast, an american case had a point substitution in the apob gene generating an in-frame stop codon. these results indicate that this disorder can be caused by OMIM188560 (s) of either an apob gene or other genes.. 
10788334	founder mutations in the brca1 gene in polish families with breast-OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. we have undertaken a hospital-based study, to identify possible brca1 and brca2 founder mutations in the polish population. the study group consisted of 66 polish families with DOID162MESHD009369 who have at least three related females affected with breast or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 and who had DOID162MESHD009369 diagnosed, in at least one of the three affected females, at age < 50 years. a total of 26 families had both breast and DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051, 4 families had DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051 only, and 36 families had breast DOID162MESHD009369 only. genomic dna was prepared from the peripheral blood leukocytes of at least one affected woman from each family. the entire coding region of brca1 and brca2 was screened for the presence of germline mutations, by use of sscp followed by direct sequencing of observed variants. mutations were found in 35 (53%) of the 66 families studied. all but one of the mutations were detected within the brca1 gene. brca1 abnormalities were identified in all four families with OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 only, in 67% of 27 families with both breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051, and in 34% of 35 families with OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 only. the single family with a brca2 mutation had the breast-OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 DOID225MESHD013577. seven distinct mutations were identified; five of these occurred in two or more families. in total, recurrent mutations were found in 33 (94%) of the 35 families with detected mutations. three brca1 abnormalities - 5382insc, c61g, and 4153dela - accounted for 51%, 20%, and 11% of the identified mutations, respectively.. 
7762560	new founder haplotypes at the OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 locus in southern africa. the association between normal alleles at the ctg repeat and two nearby polymorphisms in the myotonin protein kinase gene, the alu insertion/deletion polymorphism and the OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 kinase (dmk) (g/t) intron 9/hinfi polymorphism, has been analyzed in south african negroids, a population in which OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) has not been described. south african negroids have a ctg allelic distribution that is significantly different from that in caucasoids and japanese  the ctg repeat lengths of > or = 19 are very rare. the striking linkage disequilibrium between specific alleles at the alu polymorphism (alu (ins) and alu (del)), the hinfi polymorphism (hinfi-1 and hinfi-2), and the ctg repeat polymorphism seen in caucasoid (europeans and canadians) populations was also found in the south african negroid population. numerous haplotypes, not previously described in europeans, were, however, found. it thus seems likely that only a small number of these " african " chromosomes were present in the progenitors of all non-african peoples. these data provide support for the " out of africa " model for the origin of modern humans and suggest that the rare ancestral dm mutation event may have occurred after the migration from africa, hence the absence of dm in sub-saharan negroid peoples.. 
7573040	marked phenotypic heterogeneity associated with expansion of a cag repeat sequence at the OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827/OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 locus. the OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 locus (OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827) for type i DOID1441 (adca type i), a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of DOID1289MESHD019636, has been mapped to chromosome 14q32. 1 1. adca type i patients from families segregating OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 share clinical features in common with those with OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 (OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827), the gene of which maps to the same region. we show here that the DOID4MESHD004194 gene segregating in each of three french adca type i kindreds and in a french family with neuropathological findings suggesting the ataxochoreic form of dentatorubropallidoluysian MESHD001284 carries an expanded cag repeat sequence located at the same locus as that for OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827. analysis of the mutation in these families shows a strong negative correlation between size of the expanded cag repeat and age at onset of clinical DOID4MESHD004194. instability of the expanded triplet repeat was not found to be affected by sex of the parent transmitting the mutation. evidence was found for somatic and gonadal mosaicism for alleles carrying expanded trinucleotide repeats. 
2309698	the red-green visual pigment gene region in OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326. although recent data established that a specific very-long-chain fatty acyl-coa synthetase is defective in DOID10588OMIM300100MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326), the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 gene is still unidentified. the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 locus has been mapped to xq28, like the red and green color pigment genes. abnormal color vision has been observed in 12 of 27 patients with OMIM300100MESHD000326 (amn), a milder form of OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326. furthermore, rearrangements of the color vision gene cluster were found in four of eight OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 kindreds. this led us to propose that a single dna rearrangement could underlie both OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 and abnormal color vision in these patients. study of 34 french OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 patients failed to reveal a higher than expected frequency of green/red visual pigment rearrangements 3 to the red/green color vision gene complex. the previous report of such rearrangements was based on small numbers and lack of knowledge that the frequency of " abnormal " color vision arrays on molecular analysis was twice as high as expected on the basis of the frequency of phenotypic DOID11661DOID13399DOID13909DOID13910DOID13911DOID13912MESHD003117. the red/green color pigment (r/gcp) region was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in 14 of these patients, and we did not find any fragment size difference between the patients and normal individuals who have the same number of pigment genes. the r/gcp region was also analyzed in 29 french and seven north american OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 patients by using six genomic dna probes, isolated from a cosmid walk, that flank the color vision genes. no deletions were found with probes that lie 3 of the green pigment genes. one of the eight previously reported OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 individuals has a long deletion 5 of the red pigment gene, a deletion causing OMIM303700DOID0050679MESHC536238. this finding and the previous findings of a 45% frequency of phenotypic DOID11661DOID13399DOID13909DOID13910DOID13911DOID13912MESHD003117 in patients with amn may suggest that the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326/amn gene lies 5 to the red pigment gene and that the frequent phenotypic color vision anomalies owe their origin to deleted dna that includes regulatory genes for color vision. it is possible, however, that phenotypic color vision anomalies in amn may be phenocopies secondary to retinal or neural involvement by the DOID4MESHD004194. the single case of OMIM303700DOID0050679MESHC536238 may therefore be a fortuitous coincidence of two DOID4MESHD004194MESHC.. 
10662807	OMIM245010MESHC537627 and OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214 are allelic mutations in cathepsin c. of the many DOID3390OMIM248300MESHD007645 (ppk) conditions, only OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214 (OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214) and OMIM245010MESHC537627 (OMIM245010MESHC537627) are associated with premature periodontal destruction. although both OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214 and OMIM245010MESHC537627 share the cardinal features of ppk and severe DOID824MESHD010518, a number of additional findings are reported in OMIM245010MESHC537627 including MESHD054119, acro-MESHD010014, atrophic changes of the nails, and a radiographic MESHD000013 of the fingers. while OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214 cases have been identified throughout the world, OMIM245010MESHC537627 has only been described among descendants of a religious isolate originally from cochin, india. parental consanguinity is a characteristic of many cases of both conditions. although autosomal recessive transmission of OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214 is evident, a more " complex " autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance with phenotypic influences from a closely linked modifying locus has been hypothesised for OMIM245010MESHC537627. recently, mutations of the cathepsin c gene have been identified as the underlying genetic OMIM188560 in OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214. to determine if a cathepsin c mutation is also responsible for OMIM245010MESHC537627, we sequenced the gene in affected and unaffected subjects from the cochin isolate in which both the OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214 and OMIM245010MESHC537627 phenotypes appear. here we report identification of a mutation of cathepsin c (exon 6, 2127a-- > g) that changes a highly conserved amino acid in the cathepsin c peptide. this mutation segregates with OMIM245010MESHC537627 in four nuclear families. additionally, the existence of a shared common haplotype for genetic loci flanking the cathepsin c gene suggests that affected subjects descended from the cochin isolate are homozygous for a mutation inherited " identical by descent " from a common ancestor. this finding supports simple autosomal recessive inheritance for OMIM245010MESHC537627 in these families. we also report a mutation of the same exon 6 ctsc codon (2126c-- > t) in a turkish family with classical OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214. these findings provide evidence that OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214 and OMIM245010MESHC537627 are allelic variants of cathepsin c gene mutations.. 
10377440	x inactivation and somatic cell selection rescue female mice carrying a piga-null mutation. a somatic mutation in the x linked piga gene is responsible for the deficiency of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (gpi) -anchored proteins on blood cells from patients with DOID0060284OMIM300818OMIM615399MESHD006457. no inherited form of gpi-anchor deficiency has been described. because conventional piga gene knockout is associated with high embryonic lethality in chimeric mice, we used the cre/loxp system. we generated mice in which two loxp sites flank part of piga exon 2. after crossbreeding with female mice of the eiia-cre MESHD013180, the floxed allele undergoes cre-mediated recombination with high efficiency during early embryonic development. because of x chromosome inactivation, female offspring are mosaic for cells that express or lack gpi-linked proteins. analysis of mosaic mice showed that in heart, lung, kidney, brain, and liver, mainly wild-type piga is active, suggesting that these tissues require gpi-linked proteins. the salient exceptions were spleen, thymus, and red blood cells, which had almost equal numbers of cells expressing the wild-type or the recombined allele, implying that gpi-linked proteins are not essential for the derivation of these tissues. piga (-) cells had no growth advantage, suggesting that other factors are needed for their clonal dominance in patients with DOID0060284OMIM300818OMIM615399MESHD006457.. 
1301161	the OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 gene maps to a 150 kb region on chromosome xp11.3. OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 is a human x-linked recessive disorder of unknown etiology characterized by congenital DOID1432MESHD001766, sensory neural MESHD003638 and DOID1059MESHD008607. this DOID4MESHD004194 gene was previously linked to the dxs7 (l1. 28) locus and the mao genes in band xp11. 3 3. we report here fine physical mapping of the obligate region containing the OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 gene (ndp) defined by a recombination and by the smallest submicroscopic chromosomal deletion associated with OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 identified to date. analysis, using in addition two overlapping yac clones from this region, allowed orientation of the maoa and maob genes in a 5-3-3-5 configuration. a recombination event between a (gt) n polymorphism in intron 2 of the maob gene and the ndp locus, in a family previously reported to have a recombination between dxs7 and ndp, delineates a flanking marker telomeric to this DOID4MESHD004194 gene. an anonymous dna probe, dc12, present in one of the yacs and in a patient with a submicroscopic deletion which includes maoa and maob but not l1. 28, serves as a flanking marker centromeric to the DOID4MESHD004194 gene. an alu-pcr fragment from the right arm of the mao yac (ymao. alur) is not deleted in this patient and also delineates the centromeric extent of the obligate DOID4MESHD004194 region. the apparent order of these loci is telomere. dxs7-maoa-maob-ndp-dc12-ymao dxs7-maoa-maob-ndp-dc12-ymao. alur. centromere. together these data define the obligate region containing the ndp gene to a chromosomal segment less than 150 kb.
2393028	molecular genetics of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) mediterranean variant and description of a new g6pd mutant, g6pd andalus1361a. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd; e. c. 1. 1. 1. 49) deficiency is the most common human enzymopathy; more than 300 different biochemical variants of the enzyme have been described. in many parts of the world the mediterranean type of DOID2862MESHD005955 is prevalent. however, g6pd mediterranean has come to be regarded as a generic term applied to similar g6pd mutations thought, however, to represent a somewhat heterogeneous group. a c----t mutation at nucleotide 563 of g6pd mediterranean has been identified by vulliamy et al., and the same mutation has been found by de vita et al. in g6pd mediterranean, g6pd sassari, and g6pd cagliari. the latter subjects had an additional mutation, at nucleotide 1311, that did not produce a coding change. we have examined genomic dna of five patients--four of spanish origin and one of jewish origin--having enzymatically documented g6pd mediterranean. all had both the mutation at nucleotide 563 and that at nucleotide 1311. a sixth sample, resembling g6pd mediterranean kinetically but with a slightly rapid electrophoretic mobility, was designated g6pd andalus and was found to have a different mutation, a g----a transition at nucleotide 1361, producing an arginine-to-histidine substitution. these studies suggest that g6pd mediterranean is, after all, relatively homogeneous.
1303277	small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide n (snrpn), an expressed gene in the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 critical region. OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218) is associated with paternally derived chromosomal deletions in region 15q11-13 or with maternal disomy for chromosome 15. therefore, loss of the expressed paternal alleles of maternally imprinted genes must be responsible for the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 phenotype. we have mapped the gene encoding the small nuclear rna associated polypeptide smn (snrpn) to human chromosome 15q12 and a processed pseudogene snrpnp1 to chromosome region 6pter-p21. furthermore, snrpn was mapped to the minimal deletion interval that is critical for OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. the fact that the mouse snrpn gene is maternally imprinted in brain suggests that loss of the paternally derived snrpn allele may be involved in the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 phenotype.. 
10064668	increased incidence of DOID162MESHD009369 in patients with OMIM250250DOID14773MESHC535916. objective  previous reports have suggested an increased risk of DOID162MESHD009369 among patients with OMIM250250DOID14773MESHC535916 (OMIM250250DOID14773MESHC535916). this study was carried out to further evaluate this risk among patients with OMIM250250DOID14773MESHC535916 and their first-degree relatives. study design  one hundred twenty-two patients with OMIM250250DOID14773MESHC535916 were identified through 2 countrywide epidemiologic surveys in 1974 and in 1986. their parents and nonaffected siblings were identified through the population register center. this cohort underwent follow-up for DOID162MESHD009369 incidence through the finnish DOID162MESHD009369 registry to the end of 1995. results  a statistically significant excess risk of DOID162MESHD009369 was seen among the patients with OMIM250250DOID14773MESHC535916 (standardized incidence ratio 6. 9, 95% confidence interval 2. 3 to 16), which was mainly attributable to DOID0060060DOID8538OMIM605027MESHD008228  (standardized incidence ratio 90, 95% confidence interval 18 to 264). in addition, a significant excess risk of basal cell DOID305DOID4015MESHD002277 was seen (standardized incidence ratio 35, 95% confidence interval 7. 2 to 102). the DOID162MESHD009369 incidence among the siblings or the parents did not differ from the average DOID162MESHD009369 incidence in the finnish population. conclusions  this study confirms an increased risk of DOID162MESHD009369, especially DOID0060060DOID8538OMIM605027MESHD008228, probably attributable to defective immunity, among patients with OMIM250250DOID14773MESHC535916.
6540752	genetic polymorphism of g6pd in a bulgarian population. considerable genetic heterogeneity in g6pd was found in the bulgarian population-14 g6pd variants isolated from 117 hemizygous carriers of DOID2862MESHD005955. of these, g6pd mediterranean type was a polymorphic variant and g6pd corinth occurred with high frequency. two new variants were identified-g6pd rudosem and g6pd nedelino. in a selected group of 78 subjects with clinical manifestations, four variants were established  g6pd mediterranian, g6pd corinth, g6pd seattle and g6pd ohut ii.. 
1349199	a genetic etiology for OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062: consistent deletions and microdeletions of 22q11. OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062 (OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062), a developmental field OMIM188560 of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, is characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the thymus and parathyroid glands and by conotruncal cardiac malformations. cytogenetic studies support the presence of a OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062 critical region in band 22q11. in the present study, we report the results of clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular studies of 14 patients with OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062. chromosome analysis, utilizing high-resolution banding techniques, detected interstitial deletions in five probands and was inconclusive for a deletion in three probands. the remaining six patients had normal karyotypes. in contrast, molecular analysis detected dna deletions in all 14 probands. two of 10 loci tested, d22s75 and d22s259, are deleted in all 14 patients. a third locus, d22s66, is deleted in the eight OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062 probands tested. physical mapping using somatic cell hybrids places d22s66 between d22s75 and d22s259, suggesting that it should be deleted in the remaining six cases. parent-of-origin studies were performed in five families. four probands failed to inherit a maternal allele, and one failed to inherit a paternal allele. on the basis of these families, and of six maternally and five paternally derived unbalanced-translocation OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062 probands in the literature, parent of origin or imprinting does not appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062. deletion of the same three loci in all 14 OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062 probands begins to delineate the region of chromosome 22 critical for OMIM188400DOID11198DOID12583OMIM192430MESHD004062 and confirms the hypothesis that submicroscopic deletions of 22q11 are etiologic in the vast majority of cases.. 
1301146	characterisation of a new rare fragile site easily confused with the fragile x. a new fragile site (fraxe) in xq28 is described. it appears to be a typical folate sensitive fragile site. the fragile site is not associated with DOID1059MESHD008607, it does not give abnormal results when subjected to southern analysis with probe pfxa3 which detects the unstable dna sequence characteristic of OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600. in situ hybridization mapping locates the fragile site between 150 kb and 600 kb distal to fraxa. the distinction between the two fragile sites is important clinically since cytogenetic detection of fraxe, without molecular analysis, could result in misdiagnosis of OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600.. 
7939630	brca1 mutations in primary breast and ovarian DOID305DOID4015MESHD002277. loss of heterozygosity data from familial DOID162MESHD009369 suggest that brca1, a gene that confers susceptibility to ovarian and early-onset OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943, encodes a DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor. the brca1 region is also subject to allelic loss in sporadic breast and DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051, an indication that brca1 mutations may occur somatically in these DOID162MESHD009369. the brca1 coding region was examined for mutations in primary breast and ovarian DOID162MESHD009369 that show allele loss at the brca1 locus. mutations were detected in 3 of 32 breast and 1 of 12 ovarian DOID305DOID4015MESHD002277; all four mutations were germline alterations and occurred in early-onset DOID162MESHD009369. these results suggest that mutation of brca1 may not be critical in the development of the majority of breast and DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051 that arise in the absence of a mutant germline allele.. 
8307570	genomic structure of the ews gene and its relationship to ewsr1, a site of DOID162MESHD009369-associated chromosome translocation. the ews gene has been identified based on its location at the chromosome 22 breakpoint of the t (11; 22) (q24; q12) translocation that characterizes ewing DOID1115DOID4235DOID6193MESHD012509 and related neuroectodermal DOID162MESHD009369. the ews gene spans about 40 kb of dna and is encoded by 17 exons. the nucleotide sequence of the exons is identical to that of the previously described cdna. the first 7 exons encode the n-terminal domain of ews, which consists of a repeated degenerated polypeptide of 7 to 12 residues rich in tyrosine, serine, threonine, glycine, and glutamine. exons 11, 12, and 13 encode the putative rna binding domain. the three glycine- and arginine-rich motifs of the gene are mainly encoded by exons 8-9, 14, and 16. the dna sequence in the 5 region of the gene has features of a cpg-rich island and lacks canonical promoter elements, such as tata and ccaat consensus sequences. positions of the chromosome 22 breakpoints were determined for 19 ewing DOID162MESHD009369. they were localized in introns 7 or 8 in 18 cases and in intron 10 in 1 case.. 
8364574	pax6 mutations in DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783. DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 is a congenital malformation of the eye, chiefly characterised by iris hypoplasia, which can cause DOID1432MESHD001766. the pax6 gene was isolated as a candidate DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 gene by positional cloning from the smallest region of overlap of DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783-associated deletions. subsequently pax6 intragenic mutations were demonstrated in smalleye, a mouse mutant which is an animal model for DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783, and six human DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 patients. in this paper we describe four additional pax6 point mutations in DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 patients, both sporadic and familial. these mutations highlight regions of the gene which are essential for normal pax6 function. in addition, the frequency at which we have found pax6 mutations suggests that lesions in pax6 will account for most cases of DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783.. 
8111379	mutations in the pax6 gene in patients with hereditary DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783. the 14 exons of the pax6 gene have been analysed exon-by-exon using sscp in 6 DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783 families. in each family band shifts were observed on the sscp gels for only one exon and direct pcr-sequencing revealed mutations in each case. two mutations involved c-- > t transitions in cgaarg codons in exons 9 and 11. another c-- > t transition converted a cag-glutamine to a tag-stop in exon 7. small insertions created frameshifts which produced downstream stop codons in another two patients and an a-- > t mutation disrupted the splice donor site of exon 5 in the remaining family. thus, complete inactivation of the pax6 gene is predicted in all cases. analysis of other affected members of the families showed that, in each case, all affected individuals carried the same family-specific mutation. one polymorphism was found in exon 7. this data strongly supports the candidature of pax6 as the gene responsible for hereditary DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783.. 
10735274	locus heterogeneity in OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561. OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561 (OMIM229300MESHC565561) is the most common form of autosomal recessive MESHD001259. the DOID4MESHD004194 locus was assigned to chromosome 9 and the DOID4MESHD004194 gene, stm7/x25, has been isolated. to date most data suggest locus homogeneity in OMIM229300MESHC565561. we now provide strong evidence of a second OMIM229300MESHC565561 locus. studying two siblings with OMIM229300MESHC565561 from two families we did not detect a mutation in stm7/x25. haplotype analysis of the stm7/x25 region of chromosome 9 demonstrated that the relevant portion of chromosome 9 differs in the patients. although the patients studied had typical OMIM229300MESHC565561, one sibpair had the uncommon symptom of retained tendon reflexes. in order to investigate whether retained tendon reflexes are characteristic of OMIM229300MESHC565561 caused by the second locus, OMIM601992DOID0111219MESHC566594, we studied an unrelated OMIM229300MESHC565561 patient with retained tendon reflexes. the observation of typical mutations in stm7/x25 (gaa expansions) in this patient demonstrates that the two genetically different forms of OMIM229300MESHC565561 cannot be distinguished clinically.. 
10767326	haploinsufficiency of the transcription factors foxc1 and foxc2 results in aberrant ocular development. anterior segment developmental disorders, including MESHC535679 (ara), variably associate with harmfully elevated intraocular pressure (iop), which causes DOID1686MESHD005901. clinically observed dysgenesis does not correlate with iop, however, and the etiology of DOID1686MESHD005901 development is not understood. the forkhead transcription factor genes foxc1 (formerly mf1) and foxc2 (formerly mfh1) are expressed in the mesenchyme from which the ocular drainage structures derive. mutations in the human homolog of foxc1, fkhl7, cause dominant anterior segment defects and DOID1686MESHD005901 in various families. we show that foxc1 (+/-) mice have anterior segment abnormalities similar to those reported in human patients. these abnormalities include small or absent schlemms canal, aberrantly developed trabecular meshwork, iris hypoplasia, severely eccentric pupils and displaced schwalbes line. the penetrance of clinically obvious abnormalities varies with genetic background. in some affected eyes, collagen bundles were half normal diameter, or collagen and elastic tissue were very sparse. thus, abnormalities in extracellular matrix synthesis or organization may contribute to development of the ocular phenotypes. despite the abnormalities in ocular drainage structures in foxc1 (+/-) mice, iop was normal in almost all mice analyzed, on all genetic backgrounds and at all ages. similar abnormalities were found in foxc2 (+/-) mice, but no DOID4MESHD004194-associated mutations were identified in the human homolog fkhl14 in 32 ara patients. foxc1 (+/-) and foxc2 (+/-) mice are useful models for studying anterior segment development and its anomalies, and may allow identification of genes that interact with foxc1 and foxc2 (or fkhl7 and fkhl14) to produce a phenotype with elevated iop and DOID1686MESHD005901.. 
10446987	the OMIM607907DOID3507MESHD018223-associated collagen type ialpha1/platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) b-chain fusion gene generates a transforming protein that is processed to functional pdgf-bb. OMIM607907DOID3507MESHD018223 (OMIM607907DOID3507MESHD018223) displays chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 and 22, which OMIM174750 the collagen type ialpha1 (colia1) gene to the platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) b-chain (pdgfb) gene. to characterize the functional and structural properties of the colia1/pdgfb fusion protein, we generated a stable nih3t3 cell line that contained a DOID162MESHD009369-derived chimeric gene resulting from a coia1 intron 7-pdgfb intron 1 fusion. expression of the fusion protein led to morphological transformation and increased growth rate of these cells. the pdgf receptor kinase inhibitor cgp57148b reversed the transformed phenotype and reduced the growth rate of colia1/pdgfb-expressing cells but had no effects on control cells. the presence of dimeric colia1/pdgfb precursors was demonstrated through pdgfb immunoprecipitations of metabolically labeled cells and also by pdgfb immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblotting with colia1 antibodies. pulse-chase studies demonstrated that the colia1/pdgfb precursor was processed to an end product that was indistinguishable from wild-type pdgf-bb. finally, colia1/pdgfb-expressing cells generated DOID162MESHD009369 after s. c c. injection into nude mice, and DOID162MESHD009369 growth was reduced by treatment with cgp57148b. we conclude that the colia1/pdgfb fusion associated with OMIM607907DOID3507MESHD018223 contributes to DOID162MESHD009369 development through ectopic production of pdgf-bb and the formation of an autocrine loop. our findings, thus, suggest that pdgf receptors could be a target for pharmacological treatment of OMIM607907DOID3507MESHD018223 and OMIM607907DOID3507MESHD018223, e. g., through the use of pdgf receptor kinase inhibitors such as cgp57148b.
2006152	founder effect of a prevalent OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 mutation in the oriental population. a missense mutation has been identified in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase [OMIM178600; phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase; l-phenylalanine, tetrahydrobiopterin  oxygen oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating), ec 1. 14. 16. 1] gene in a chinese patient with classic OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 (OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661). a g-to-c transition at the second base of codon 413 in exon 12 of the gene results in the substitution of pro413 for arg413 in the mutant protein. this mutation (r413p) results in negligible enzymatic activity when expressed in heterologous mammalian cells and is compatible with a classic OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 phenotype in the patient. population genetic studies reveal that this mutation is tightly linked to restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotype 4, which is the predominant haplotype of the OMIM178600 locus in the oriental population. it accounts for 13. 8% of northern chinese and 27% of japanese OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 alleles, but it is rare in southern chinese (2. 2%) and is absent in the caucasian population. the data demonstrate unambiguously that the mutation occurred after racial divergence of orientals and caucasians and suggest that the allele has spread throughout the orient by a founder effect. previous protein polymorphism studies in eastern asia have led to the hypothesis that " northern mongoloids " represented a founding population in asia. our results are compatible with this hypothesis in that the OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 mutation might have occurred in northern mongoloids and subsequently spread to the chinese and japanese populations.
10528243	late-onset familial mediterranean MESHD005334 (OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505): a subset with distinct clinical, demographic, and molecular genetic characteristics. to determine the prevalence and characterize demographic, clinical, and genetic features of familial mediterranean MESHD005334 (OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505) of late onset, all patients experiencing their first OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 attack at age 40 years or more were identified using the computerized registry of our OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 clinic, and then thoroughly interviewed and examined. the control group consisted of 40 consecutive OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 patients, who arrived at the OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 clinic for their regular follow-up visit and were 40 years of age or older at the time of the examination. the severity of the DOID4MESHD004194 in patients and controls was determined using a modified score, developed previously. mutational analysis in the OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 gene was performed using a commercial kit. only 20 of 4000 (0. 5%) patients had late-onset OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505. these patients were mostly men, of non-north african origin, p < 0. 05 compared to controls. all had abdominal attacks and in most these were the only manifestation of their DOID4MESHD004194, p < 0. 001 001. none had chronic or prolonged manifestations of OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505, for example, DOID9120MESHD000686, chronic DOID848MESHD001168, or protracted MESHD063806, p < 0. 001. the response to treatment was good despite using low colchicine dose, p < 0. 05. the overall severity score indicated a mild DOID4MESHD004194, p < 0. 001. mutational analysis revealed absence of m694v homozygosity, p < 0. 01, compared to our regular OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 population. we conclude that the onset of OMIM249100DOID2987MESHD010505 in a late age defines a milder form of DOID4MESHD004194 with typical clinical, demographic, and molecular genetic characteristics 
8195156	structure of the human na+/glucose cotransporter gene sglt1. intestinal uptake of dietary glucose and galactose is mediated by the sglt1 na +/glucose cotransporter of the brush border. an sglt1 missense mutation underlies hereditary OMIM606824MESHC562602, characterized by potentially fatal DOID13250OMIM614616OMIM615863MESHD003967; conversely, oral rehydration therapy exploits normal transport to alleviate life-threatening DOID13250OMIM614616OMIM615863MESHD003967 of infectious origin. we have mapped the entire human sglt1 na +/glucose cotransporter gene from cosmid and lambda phage clones representing a genomic region of 112 kilobases. transcription initiation occurred from a site 27 base pairs 3 of a tataa sequence. all exon-flanking regions were sequenced, and the entire 112-kilobase region mapped with four restriction enzymes. sglt1 is comprised of 15 exons (spanning 72 kilobases); a possible evolutionary origin from a six-membrane-span ancestral precursor via a gene duplication event is suggested from comparison of exons against protein secondary structure and from sequence considerations. a new missense mutation in exon 1 causing OMIM606824MESHC562602 is also described. this is the first na (+) -dependent cotransporter gene structure reported. these data facilitate the search for new OMIM606824MESHC562602-related mutations in this important gene and provide a basis for future evolutionary comparisons with other na (+) -dependent cotransporters.. 
10766245	atm phosphorylates p95/nbs1 in an s-phase checkpoint pathway. the MESHD035583 MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 (at), caused by mutations in the atm gene, and OMIM251260DOID7400MESHD049932 (OMIM251260OMIM601358DOID7400MESHC536116MESHD049932), with mutations in the p95/nbs1 gene, share a variety of phenotypic abnormalities such as MESHD043171, radiation sensitivity and defects in cell-cycle checkpoints in response to ionizing radiation. the atm gene encodes a protein kinase that is activated by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic drugs, whereas p95/nbs1 is part of a protein complex that is involved in responses to dna double-strand breaks. here, because of the similarities between at and OMIM251260OMIM601358DOID7400MESHC536116MESHD049932, we evaluated the functional interactions between atm and p95/nbs1. activation of the atm kinase by ionizing radiation and induction of atm-dependent responses in OMIM251260OMIM601358DOID7400MESHC536116MESHD049932 cells indicated that p95/nbs1 may not be required for signalling to atm after ionizing radiation. however, p95/nbs1 was phosphorylated on serine 343 in an atm-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo after ionizing radiation. a p95/nbs1 construct mutated at the atm phosphorylation site abrogated an s-phase checkpoint induced by ionizing radiation in normal cells and failed to compensate for this functional deficiency in OMIM251260OMIM601358DOID7400MESHC536116MESHD049932 cells. these observations link atm and p95/nbs1 in a common signalling pathway and provide an explanation for phenotypic similarities in these two DOID4MESHD004194MESHC.. 
1671881	two distinct mutations at a single bamhi site in OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661. classical OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 is an autosomal recessive DOID4MESHD004194 caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600). the abolition of an invariant bamhi site located in the coding sequence of the OMIM178600 gene (exon 7) led to the recognition of two new point mutations at codon 272 and 273 (272gly----stop and 273ser----phe, respectively). both mutations were detected in north eastern france or belgium and occurred on the background of rflp haplotype 7 alleles. the present study supports the view that the clinical heterogeneity in OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 is accounted for by the large variety of mutant genotypes associated with OMIM178600 deficiencies.. 
10839544	functional link between MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 and OMIM251260DOID7400MESHD049932 gene products. MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 (a-t) and OMIM251260DOID7400MESHD049932 (OMIM251260OMIM601358DOID7400MESHC536116MESHD049932) are recessive DOID630MESHD030342 with susceptibility to DOID162MESHD009369 and similar cellular phenotypes. the protein product of the gene responsible for a-t, designated atm, is a member of a family of kinases characterized by a carboxy-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like domain. the nbs1 protein is specifically mutated in patients with OMIM251260DOID7400MESHD049932 and forms a complex with the dna repair proteins rad50 and mrel1. here we show that phosphorylation of nbs1, induced by ionizing radiation, requires catalytically active atm. complexes containing atm and nbs1 exist in vivo in both untreated cells and cells treated with ionizing radiation. we have identified two residues of nbs1, ser 278 and ser 343 that are phosphorylated in vitro by atm and whose modification in vivo is essential for the cellular response to dna damage. this response includes s-phase checkpoint activation, formation of the nbs1/mrel1/rad50 nuclear foci and rescue of DOID1205MESHD006967 to ionizing radiation. together, these results demonstrate a biochemical link between cell-cycle checkpoints activated by dna damage and dna repair in two DOID630MESHD030342 with overlapping phenotypes.. 
8499920	structure and genomic sequence of the OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm kinase) gene. the mutation causing OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) has recently been identified as an unstable ctg trinucleotide repeat located in the 3 untranslated region of a gene encoding for a protein with putative serine-threonine protein kinase activity. in this report we present the genomic sequences of the human and murine dm kinase gene. a comparison of these sequences with each other and with known cdna sequences from both species, led us to predict a translation initiation codon, as well as determine the organization of the dm kinase gene. several polymorphisms within the human dm kinase gene have been identified, and pcr assays to detect two of these are described. the complete sequence and characterization of the structure of the dm kinase gene, as well as the identification of novel polymorphisms within the gene, represent an important step in a further understanding of the genetics of OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 and the molecular biology of the gene.. 
10712201	identification of novel imprinted transcripts in the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 and OMIM105830DOID1932MESHD017204 deletion region: further evidence for regional imprinting control. deletions and other abnormalities of human chromosome 15q11-q13 are associated with two developmental disorders, OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218) and OMIM105830DOID1932MESHD017204 (as). loss of expression of imprinted, paternally expressed genes has been implicated in OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. however, the number of imprinted genes that contribute to OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218, and the range over which the imprinting signal acts to silence one copy of the gene in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, are unknown. to identify additional imprinted genes that could contribute to the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 phenotype and to understand the regional control of imprinting in 15q11-q13, we have constructed an imprinted transcript map of the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218-as deletion interval. the imprinting status of 22 expressed sequence tags derived from the radiation-hybrid human transcript maps or physical maps was determined in a reverse transcriptase-pcr assay and correlated with the position of the transcripts on the physical map. seven new paternally expressed transcripts localize to an approximately 1. 5-mb domain surrounding the snrpn-associated imprinting center, which already includes four imprinted, paternally expressed genes. all other tested new transcripts in the deletion region were expressed from both alleles. a domain of exclusive paternal expression surrounding the imprinting center suggests strong regional control of the imprinting process. this study provides the means for further investigation of additional genes that cause or modify the phenotypes associated with rearrangements of 15q11-q13. 
10441573	penetrances of brca1 1675dela and 1135insa with respect to OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. for genetic counseling and predictive testing in families with inherited breast-OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051, penetrances and expressions of the underlying mutations should be known. we have previously reported two brca1 founder mutations in the norwegian population. index cases for the present study were found two different ways  through a series of consecutive DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051 (n = 16) and through our family DOID162MESHD009369 clinic (n = 14). altogether, 20 of the patients had brca1 1675dela, and 10 had 1135insa. their relatives were described with respect to absence/presence of breast and/or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. of 133 living female relatives, 83 (62%) were tested for the presence of a mutation. no difference, in penetrance and expression, between the two mutations were found, whereas differences according to method of ascertainment were seen. the overall findings were that DOID4MESHD004194 started to occur at age 30 years and that by age 50 years 48% of the mutation-carrying women had experienced breast and/or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. more DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051 than breast DOID162MESHD009369 were recorded. both penetrance and expression (OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 vs. OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051) were different from those in reports of the ashkenazi founder mutations. whether the reported differences reflect true differences and/or methodological problems is discussed. an observed excess of mutation carriers could not be accounted for by methodological problems; possible explanations were a " true " low penetrance or preferential segregation.. 
7535801	molecular basis of subtotal complement OMIM612446MESHC567307. a carboxy-terminally truncated but functionally active c6. individuals with subtotal complement OMIM612446MESHC567307 possess a c6 molecule that is 14% shorter than normal c6 and present in low but detectable concentrations (1-2% of the normal mean). we now show that this dysmorphic c6 is bactericidally active and lacks an epitope that was mapped to the most carboxy-terminal part of c6 using c6 cdna fragments expressed as fusion proteins in the puex expression system. we thus predicted that the abnormal c6 molecule might be carboxy-terminally truncated and sought a mutation in an area approximately 14% from the carboxy-terminal end of the coding sequence. by sequencing pcr-amplified products from this region, we found, in three individuals from two families, a mutation that might plausibly be responsible for the OMIM188560. all three have an abnormal 5 splice donor site of intron 15, which would probably prevent splicing. an in-frame stop codon is found 17 codons downstream from the intron boundary, which would lead to a truncated polypeptide 13. 5% smaller than normal c6. this result was unexpected, as earlier studies mapped the c5b binding site, or a putative enzymatic region, to this part of c6. interestingly, all three subjects were probably heterozygous for both subtotal c6 and complete OMIM612446MESHC567307. 
10408776	mutations of the OMIM193300 gene in sporadic DOID4450DOID4464DOID4465DOID4467DOID4471DOID4473OMIM144700OMIM300854OMIM605074MESHD002292: definition of a risk factor for OMIM193300 patients to develop an OMIM144700DOID4450DOID4464DOID4465DOID4467DOID4471DOID4473OMIM300854OMIM605074MESHD002292. to investigate the nature of somatic von hippel-lindau (OMIM193300) mutations, we analyzed 173 primary sporadic human DOID4450DOID4464DOID4465DOID4467DOID4471DOID4473OMIM144700OMIM300854OMIM605074MESHD002292 for mutations of the OMIM193300 DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor gene, using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (sscp) of dna. we detected abnormal sscp pattern in 73 samples. after sequencing, we identified microdeletions in 58% of cases, microinsertions in 17%, nonsense mutations in 8%, and missense mutations in 17%. among these mutations, 50% correspond to new mutations. OMIM193300 mutations were found only in the nonpapillary DOID4450DOID4464DOID4465DOID4467DOID4471DOID4473OMIM144700OMIM300854OMIM605074MESHD002292 (OMIM144700DOID4450DOID4464DOID4465DOID4467DOID4471DOID4473OMIM300854OMIM605074MESHD002292) subtype, as previously reported. to compare somatic and germline mutations, we used the OMIM193300 database, which includes 507 mutations. the study of mutational events revealed a significant difference between somatic and germline mutations with mutations leading to truncated proteins observed in 78% of somatic mutations vs only 37% in germline mutations (p < 0. 001). we postulated that a specific pattern of OMIM193300 mutations is associated with sporadic OMIM144700DOID4450DOID4464DOID4465DOID4467DOID4471DOID4473OMIM300854OMIM605074MESHD002292. this pattern corresponds to mutations leading mainly to truncated proteins with few specific missense mutations. we then analyzed the occurrence of OMIM144700DOID4450DOID4464DOID4465DOID4467DOID4471DOID4473OMIM300854OMIM605074MESHD002292 in OMIM193300 families, based on the nature of mutations. we observed OMIM144700DOID4450DOID4464DOID4465DOID4467DOID4471DOID4473OMIM300854OMIM605074MESHD002292 in at least one member of the OMIM193300 families in 77% of cases with mutations leading to truncated proteins versus 55% in cases with missense mutations (p < 0. 05). thus, mutations resulting in truncated proteins may lead to a higher risk of OMIM144700DOID4450DOID4464DOID4465DOID4467DOID4471DOID4473OMIM300854OMIM605074MESHD002292 in OMIM193300 patients 
10911990	OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223: the role of the cug triplet repeats in splicing of a novel dmpk exon and altered cytoplasmic dmpk mrna isoform ratios. the mechanism by which (ctg) n expansion in the 3 utr of the dmpk gene causes OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) is unknown. we identified four rna splicing factors--hnrnp c, u2af (u2 auxiliary factor), ptb (polypyrimidine tract binding protein), and psf (ptb associated splicing factor) --that bind to two short regions 3 of the (cug) n, and found a novel 3 dmpk exon resulting in an mrna lacking the repeats. we propose that the (cug) n is an essential cis acting element for this splicing event. in contrast to (cug) n containing mrnas, the novel isoform is not retained in the nucleus in dm cells, resulting in imbalances in relative levels of cytoplasmic dmpk mrna isoforms and a new dominant effect of the mutation on dmpk.. 
10077651	mechanism of increased iron absorption in murine model of hereditary OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 : increased duodenal expression of the iron transporter OMIM600795MESHC579991. hereditary OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 (hh) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by tissue iron deposition secondary to excessive dietary iron absorption. we recently reported that OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432, the protein defective in hh, was physically associated with the transferrin receptor (tfr) in duodenal crypt cells and proposed that mutations in OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 attenuate the uptake of transferrin-bound iron from plasma by duodenal crypt cells, leading to up-regulation of transporters for dietary iron. here, we tested the hypothesis that OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432-/- mice have increased duodenal expression of the divalent metal transporter (OMIM600795MESHC579991). by 4 weeks of age, the OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432-/- mice demonstrated iron loading when compared with OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 +/+ littermates, with elevated transferrin saturations (68. 4% vs. 49. 8%) and elevated liver iron concentrations (985 micrograms vs. 381 micrograms). by using northern blot analyses, we quantitated duodenal expression of both classes of OMIM600795MESHC579991 transcripts  one containing an iron responsive element (ire), called OMIM600795MESHC579991 (ire), and one containing no ire, called OMIM600795MESHC579991 (non-ire). the positive control for OMIM600795MESHC579991 up-regulation was a murine model of dietary iron deficiency that demonstrated greatly increased levels of duodenal OMIM600795MESHC579991 (ire) mrna. OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432-/- mice also demonstrated an increase in duodenal OMIM600795MESHC579991 (ire) mrna (average 7. 7-fold), despite their elevated transferrin saturation and hepatic iron content. duodenal expression of OMIM600795MESHC579991 (non-ire) was not increased, nor was hepatic expression of OMIM600795MESHC579991 increased. these data support the model for hh in which OMIM235200DOID2352MESHD006432 mutations lead to inappropriately low crypt cell iron, with resultant stabilization of OMIM600795MESHC579991 (ire) mrna, up-regulation of OMIM600795MESHC579991, and increased absorption of dietary iron.

1269174	OMIM616000MESHD034141 in an american indian girl. OMIM616000MESHD034141 was fortuitously detected in a nonedematous 12-year-old american indian girl with atopic DOID2723MESHD003872, mild OMIM600807MESHD001249, a mild DOID11832MESHD012640 disorder, and DOID1168MESHD006951 with a OMIM107800DOID11342MESHD001112. immunologic methods revealed trace amounts (17 mg/100 ml) of apparently normal serum albumin. the patients parents were remotely related. the pedigree and clinical findings were compatible with autosomal recessive transmission of OMIM616000MESHD034141. heterozygotes had subnormal levels of serum albumin. the gc-locus is closely linked to the structural albumin locus. gc-protein levels were normal in the patient and together with normal chromosomal banding studies make it unlikely that a chromosomal deletion caused OMIM616000MESHD034141. gc-types in the family were compatible with, but did not prove, linkage of OMIM616000MESHD034141 to the gc-locus. these findings suggest a " DOID10241MESHD013789 " -like mutation for this disorder.. 
3524231	treatment of duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 with growth hormone inhibitors. a controlled, double-blind therapeutic trial with the drug mazindol, a growth hormone inhibitor, was performed in a pair of 7 1/2 year-old monozygotic twins, with duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388). the rationale for this trial was based on a patient (reported previously) affected simultaneously with OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 and growth hormone (gh) deficiency, who is showing a benign course of the dystrophic process and is still walking at 18 years. one of the twins received 2 mg of mazindol daily, while the other received a placebo. the assessment, repeated every 2 months, OMIM612069MESHC567429OMIM606217MESHC565249OMIM115197MESHC566169DOID0110552OMIM606346DOID0110494OMIM609006OMIM300123MESHC567485DOID0111806OMIM610125MESHC566441DOID0110927OMIM161800OMIM611590MESHC566910OMIM613750MESHC563526 weight and height measurements, functional and motor ability tests, ergometry and determinations of serum enzymes and gh levels. after one year of trial the code was broken and it was seen that the twin under placebo treatment was strikingly worse than his brother, the progression of whose condition was practically arrested. these results strongly suggest that treatment with a gh inhibitor is beneficial for OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 patients.. 
8528198	identification of wasp mutations in patients with OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 and isolated DOID1588MESHD013921 reveals allelic heterogeneity at the was locus. mutation in the gene encoding the recently isolated wasp protein has now been identified as the genetic OMIM188560 responsible for the x-linked OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 (was), a DOID612MESHD000081207 associated with extensive phenotypic variability. to elucidate the range of wasp mutations responsible for was, we used pcr-sscp analysis to screen for wasp gene mutation in 19 unrelated boys with the diagnosis of classical or attenuated was or isolated DOID1588MESHD013921. all 19 patients had wasp mutations, each of which localized to the initial three or terminal three exons of the gene, and the majority of which were unique in each case. however, a missense mutation which results in substitution of the arginine at was codon 86 was identified in three boys with severe was as well as in one boy presenting with DOID1588MESHD013921 alone. while the three mutations found in the isolated DOID1588MESHD013921 patients leave the reading frame intact, about one-half of the gene alterations detected in both severe and attenuated was patients result in frameshifted transcript and premature translation termination. these findings therefore confirm the association of was with wasp mutation and identify wasp mutation as a cause for isolated congenital DOID1588MESHD013921 in males. while the wasp gene defects responsible for isolated DOID1588MESHD013921 and other mild presentations of was do not appear distinct from those resulting in severe was, these data indicate that analysis of wasp gene mutation provides a valuable tool for distinguishing the spectrum of was patients and the subset of males with isolated DOID1588MESHD013921 who represent mild cases of was.. 
8178825	OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 without cag expansion: phenocopies or errors in assignment? OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 (hd) has been shown to be associated with an expanded cag repeat within a novel gene on 4p16. 3 (it15). a total of 30 of 1, 022 affected persons (2. 9% of our cohort) did not have an expanded cag in the DOID4MESHD004194 range. the reasons for not observing expansion in affected individuals are important for determining the sensitivity of using repeat length both for diagnosis of affected patients and for predictive testing programs and may have biological relevance for the understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying hd. here we show that the majority (18) of the individuals with normal sized alleles represent misdiagnosis, sample mix-up, or clerical error. the remaining 12 patients represent possible phenocopies for hd. in at least four cases, family studies of these phenocopies excluded 4p16. 3 as the region responsible for the phenotype. mutations in the hd gene that are other than cag expansion have not been excluded for the remaining eight cases; however, in as many as seven of these persons, retrospective review of these patients clinical features identified characteristics not typical for hd. this study shows that on rare occasions mutations in other, as-yet-undefined genes can present with a clinical phenotype very similar to that of hd 
6101415	allelic exclusion of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in platelets and t lymphocytes from a OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 carrier. an obligate carrier of the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 (was) who was also heterozygous for the a and b types of x-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was found. with her it became possible to determine whether allelic exclusion occurs in particular cell-types of the was carrier. if so, the remaining cells of a particular cell-type would express only the normal x chromosome and only one glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzyme would be demonstrable. this carrier had only the b isoenzyme of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in platelets and thymus-derived t lymphocytes, although both isoenzymes a and b were present in erythrocytes and neutrophils. these findings suggest that selection against the was gene occurs in platelets and thymus-derived t lymphocytes and that the defects associated with was expressed in these cell-types may be implicated in the genesis of the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923.. 
10487695	a novel mutation in the sodium/iodide symporter gene in the largest family with iodide transport OMIM188560. we previously reported nine children with an autosomally recessive form of DOID0050328MESHD003409 due to an iodide transport OMIM188560 in a large hutterite family with extensive consanguinity living in central canada. since the original report, we have diagnosed DOID0050328MESHD003409 by newborn tsh screening in 9 additional children from the family. we performed direct sequencing of the pcr products of each nis (sodium/iodide symporter) gene exon with flanking introns amplified from genomic dna extracted from peripheral blood cells of the patients. we identified a novel nis gene mutation, g395r (gly395-- > arg; gga-- > OMIM109200), in 10 patients examined in the present study. all of the parents tested were heterozygous for the mutation, suggesting that the patients were homozygous. the mutation was located in the 10th transmembrane OMIM617671. expression experiments by transfection of the mutant nis complimentary dna into cos-7 cells showed no perchlorate-sensitive iodide uptake, confirming that the mutation is the direct cause of the iodide transport OMIM188560 in these patients. a patient who showed an intermediate saliva/serum technetium ratio (14. 0; normal, > or = 20) and was considered to have a partial or less severe OMIM188560 in the previous report (ix-24) did not have a nis gene mutation. it is now possible to use gene diagnostics of this unique nis mutation to identify patients with DOID0050328MESHD003409 due to an iodide transport OMIM188560 in this family and to determine the carrier state of potential parents for genetic counseling and arranging rapid and early diagnosis of their infants. 
2071157	determination of the mutations responsible for the OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926 in 17 subjects. hypoxanthine--guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) is a purine salvage enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate and guanine to guanosine monophosphate. previous studies of mutant hprt proteins analyzed at the molecular level have shown a significant heterogeneity. this investigation further verifies this heterogeneity and identifies insertions, deletions, and point mutations. the direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified product of reverse-transcribed hprt mrna enabled the rapid identification of the mutations found in 17 previously uncharacterized cell lines derived from patients with the OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926.. 
7444053	a new ct pattern in OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326. a new ct pattern was observed in 2 patients with OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326). this pattern, which the authors call type ii, is characterized by the absence of posterior periventricular areas of decreased attenuation around the trigone on non-contrast scans  after contrast infusion, however, there is striking enhancement of various white-matter structures (tracts or fiber systems) such as the internal capsules, corpus callosum, corona radiata, forceps major, and cerebral peduncles. this is different from numerous previous descriptions of the ct pattern in OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326. type ii OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 does not appear to have been seen in any other MESHD056784 and is probably specific for a phenotypic variant or an evolving stage of OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326.. 
10706858	genetic analysis, phenotypic diagnosis, and risk of OMIM188050MESHD019851MESHD020246 in families with inherited deficiencies of protein s. DOID2451MESHD018455 is a recognized risk factor for OMIM188050MESHD019851MESHD020246. of all the inherited thrombophilic conditions, it remains the most difficult to diagnose because of phenotypic variability, which can lead to inconclusive results. we have overcome this problem by studying a cohort of patients from a single center where the diagnosis was confirmed at the genetic level. twenty-eight index patients with DOID2451MESHD018455 and a pros1 gene OMIM188560 were studied, together with 109 first-degree relatives. to avoid selection bias, we confined analysis of total and free protein s levels and thrombotic risk to the patients relatives. in this group of relatives, a low free protein s level was the most reliable predictor of a pros1 gene OMIM188560 (sensitivity 97. 7%, specificity 100%). first-degree relatives with a pros1 gene OMIM188560 had a 5. 0-fold higher risk of DOID0060903MESHD013927 (95% confidence interval, 1. 5-16. 8) than those with a normal pros1 gene and no other recognized thrombophilic OMIM188560. although pregnancy/puerperium and immobility/MESHD014947 were important precipitating factors for DOID0060903MESHD013927, almost half of the events were spontaneous. relatives with splice-site or major structural defects in the pros1 gene were more likely to have had a thrombotic event and had significantly lower total and free protein s levels than those relatives having missense mutations. we conclude that persons with pros1 gene defects and DOID2451MESHD018455 are at increased risk of DOID0060903MESHD013927 and that free protein s estimation offers the most reliable way of diagnosing the deficiency.

10382910	severe clinical expression in x-linked emery-dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136. x-linked emery-dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136 (DOID11726) is a relatively rare benign neuromuscular disorder which can vary remarkably in onset, course and severity. in the present study, a tctac deletion spanning the nucleotides 631-635 of the emerin gene caused an unusually severe DOID4MESHD004194 phenotype including loss of ambulation and severe DOID767 in two affected brothers. the same mutation has been reported previously in an unrelated family showing a significantly milder phenotype. the interfamilial heterogeneity in distribution and in severity of the features in the two families point to environmental or genetic modification as the cause of clinical variability in emery-dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136.. 
7825578	the gene for spinal cerebellar MESHD001259 3 (OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827) is located in a region of approximately 3 cm on chromosome 14q24.3-q32.2. OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827, the gene for spinal cerebellar MESHD001259 3, was recently mapped to a 15-cm interval between d14s67 and d14s81 on chromosome 14q, by linkage analysis in two families of french ancestry. the OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 candidate region has now been refined by linkage analysis with four new microsatellite markers (d14s256, d14s291, d14s280, and afm343vf1) in the same two families, in which 19 additional individuals were genotyped, and in a third french family. combined two-point linkage analyses show that the new markers, d14s280 and afm343vf1, are tightly linked to the OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 locus, with maximal lod scores, at recombination fraction, (theta) =. 00, of 7. 05 and 13. 70, respectively. combined multipoint and recombinant haplotype analyses localize the OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 locus to a 3-cm interval flanked by d14s291 and d14s81. the same allele for d14s280 segregates with the DOID4MESHD004194 locus in the three kindreds. this allele is frequent in the french population, however, and linkage disequilibrium is not clearly established. the OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 locus remains within the 29-cm region on 14q24. 3-q32. 2 containing the gene for the OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827, which is clinically related to the phenotype determined by OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827, but it cannot yet be concluded that both DOID4MESHD004194MESHC result from alterations of the same gene 
1831007	OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 and childhood-onset OMIM137580DOID11119MESHD005879. a 40-year-old man with childhood-onset OMIM137580DOID11119MESHD005879 (ts) developed OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 (hd). we believe this to be the first reported case of childhood-onset ts with adult onset hd. discovery of other cases with both disorders may provide clues to the pathophysiology of both conditions.. 
7761412	the protein deficient in OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 is a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase. OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800, also known as DOID1056OMIM309000MESHD009800, is caused by mutations in the x chromosome-encoded OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 gene. the OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 protein is 51% identical to inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase ii (5-phosphatase ii) from human platelets over a span of 744 aa, suggesting that OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 may be a similar enzyme. we engineered a construct of the OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 cdna that encodes amino acids homologous to the platelet 5-phosphatase for expression in baculovirus-infected sf9 insect cells. this cdna encodes aa 264-968 of the OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 protein. the recombinant protein was found to catalyze the reactions also carried out by platelet 5-phosphatase ii. thus OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 converts inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate to inositol 1, 4-bisphosphate, and it converts inositol 1, 3, 4, 5-tetrakisphosphate to inositol 1, 3, 4-trisphosphate. most important, the enzyme converts phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. the relative ability of OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 to catalyze the three reactions is different from that of 5-phosphatase ii and from that of another 5-phosphatase isoenzyme from platelets, 5-phosphatase i. the recombinant OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 protein hydrolyzes the phospholipid substrate 10- to 30-fold better than 5-phosphatase ii, and 5-phosphatase i does not cleave the lipid at all. we also show that OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 functions as a phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase in OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800-expressing sf9 cells. these results suggest that OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 is mainly a lipid phosphatase that may control cellular levels of a critical metabolite, phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate. deficiency of this enzyme apparently causes the protean manifestations of OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800.. 
10323740	microdeletions at chromosome bands 1q32-q41 as a cause of DOID0060239OMIM119300MESHC536528. DOID0060239OMIM119300MESHC536528 (vws) is an OMIM178110MESHC566739 disorder comprising DOID9296MESHD002971 and/or OMIM119540DOID674MESHD002972MESHC566991 and OMIM247610 pits. we reported previously a family whose underlying mutation is a 500-800 kb deletion localized to chromosome bands 1q32-q41 [sander et al., 1994  hum mol genet 3  576-578]. along with DOID9296MESHD002971/palate and OMIM247610 pits, affected relatives exhibit developmental delays, suggesting that the function of a gene nearby may also be disrupted. to further localize the vws gene we searched for other deletions that cause vws. an allele loss assay was performed using a novel highly polymorphic marker, d1s3753. from a panel of 37 unrelated individuals, we detected an allele loss in one family, indicating the presence of a deletion. in this family, the phenotype in three generations of affected individuals was confined to the cardinal signs of vws. surprisingly, mapping of the new deletion showed that it extended 0. 2-1 mb beyond the proximal breakpoint for the deletion described previously. no deletions were detected in seven cases of popliteal pterygia DOID225MESHD013577, 76 cases of mixed syndromic forms of DOID9296MESHD002971 and palate, and 178 cases of nonsyndromic DOID9296MESHD002971 and palate.

DOID12798MESHD009083 OMIM243500DOID14753MESHC538167 (mps OMIM243500DOID14753MESHC538167) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in n-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (galns). we found two separate deletions of nearly 8. 0 and 6. 0 kb in the galns gene, including some exons. there are alu repetitive elements near the breakpoints of the 8. 0-kb deletion, and this deletion resulted from an alu-alu recombination. the other 6. 0-kb deletion involved illegitimate recombinational events between incomplete short direct repeats of 8 bp at deletion breakpoints. the same rearrangement has been observed in a heteroallelic state in four unrelated patients. this is the first documentation of a common double deletion a gene that is not a member of a gene cluster.
2995231	segregation analysis of a marker localised xp21.2-xp21.3 in duchenne and becker DOID9884MESHD009136 families. a dna marker c7, localised xp21. 1-xp21. 3, has been studied in kindreds segregating for duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) and becker DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826). in OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 families four crossovers were observed in 38 informative meioses between c7 and the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 locus (theta = 0. 12, z max = + 2. 72). in OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826 families no recombinants were observed in the 16 informative meioses studied. these data are consistent with the localisation of the mutations in these disorders being in the same region of xp21. studies in families also segregating for the dna marker 754 support the previously reported physical order of these loci as x centromere-754-OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388-OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826-c7-x telomere. a recombination fraction of 0. 11 (z max = + 5. 58) was found between OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388-754 by combining our previously published data with the data presented here. c7 and 754 thus provide good bridging markers for the diagnosis of OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 and OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826 
8281142	genetic analysis of the brca1 region in a DOID10688/ovarian family: refinement of the minimal region containing brca1. we have analyzed a single multi-affected breast/OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 pedigree (bov3) and have shown consistent inheritance of markers on chromosome 17q with the DOID4MESHD004194 confirming that this family is due to the brca1 gene. analysis of 17q haplotypes shows a recombination event in a bilateral OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 case which suggests that the brca1 gene lies distal to d17s857; d17s857 is thus the new proximal boundary for the region containing brca1. combining this information with previously published mapping information suggests that brca1 is contained in a region estimated at 1-1. 5 mb in length. all seven breast tumour/blood pairs examined from this family show loss of heterozygosity in the tumours. the allel retained in each tumour was from the DOID4MESHD004194-bearing chromosome implicating brca1 as a tumour suppressor gene. we have sequenced the 17 beta-oestradiol dehydrogenase genes (edh17b1 and edh17b2) which have been suggested as candidate genes for brca1 in four members of this family. no germline mutations were detected. 
10590055	a point mutation thr(799)met on the alpha(2) integrin leads to the formation of new human platelet alloantigen sit(a) and affects collagen-induced aggregation. a new platelet-specific alloantigen, termed sit (a), was identified in a severe case of MESHD054098. the sit (a) alloantigen is of low frequency (1/400) in the german population. immunochemical studies demonstrated that the sit (a) epitopes reside on platelet glycoprotein (gp) ia. nucleotide sequence analysis of gpia cdna derived from sit (a) -positive platelets showed c (2531) -- > t (2531) point mutation, resulting in thr (799) met dimorphism. analysis of genomic dna from 22 sit (a) -negative normal individuals showed that the thr (799) is encoded by acg (2532) (90. 9%) or aca (2532) (9. 1%). to establish a dna typing technique, we elucidated the organization of the gpia gene adjacent to the polymorphic bases. the introns (421 bp and 1. 2 kb) encompass a 142-bp exon with the 2 polymorphic bases 2531 and 2532. polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on dna derived from 100 donors using the restriction enzyme OMIM616421 iii showed that the met (799) form of gpia is restricted to sit (a) (+) phenotype. analysis of stable chinese hamster ovary transfectants expressing allele-specific recombinant forms of gpia showed that anti-sit (a) exclusively reacted with the glu (505) met (799), but not with the glu (505) thr (799) and the lys (505) thr (799) isoforms. in contrast, anti-br (a) (hpa-5b) only recognized the lys (505) thr (799) form, whereas anti-br (b) (hpa-5a) reacted with both glu (505) thr (799) and glu (505) met (799) isoforms. these results demonstrated that the met (799) is responsible for formation of the sit (a) alloantigenic determinants, whereas amino acid 505 (lys or glu) specifically controls the expression of br (a) and br (b) epitopes, respectively. platelet aggregation responses of sit (a) (+) individuals were diminished in response to collagen, indicating that the thr (799) met mutation affects the function of the gpia/iia complex 
3464560	estimation of the male to female ratio of mutation rates from the segregation of x-chromosomal dna haplotypes in duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 families. a novel procedure is presented to estimate the ratio of male to female mutation rates for duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388). x-specific restriction fragment length polymorphisms are used to establish dna haplotypes in three-generation OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 families. from the proportion of OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 patients who have inherited their maternal grandfathers x chromosome, the ratio of mutation rates can be calculated. in contrast to classical methods, the proposed procedure is not restricted to sporadic or familiar cases nor is any information on the carrier status of female relatives required.. 
3789016	genetic analysis of an inherited deficiency of the third component of complement in brittany spaniel dogs. genetically determined DOID8354 in brittany spaniel dogs shares a number of biochemical and clinical characteristics with the human disorder. in humans, the gene for DOID8354 is a null gene that is allelic to the structural gene for c3 and is not linked to the major histocompatibility locus. the current study used allotype analysis of canine c3 in order to demonstrate that the gene for DOID8354 in these dogs is also a null gene allelic to the structural gene for c3. in addition, preliminary pedigree analysis suggests that the gene for canine DOID8354 is apparently not closely linked to the major histocompatibility complex of the dog. thus, it appears that DOID8354 in brittany spaniel dogs not only shares biochemical and clinical features with DOID8354 in humans, but also shares some genetic characteristics with the human disorder.. 
10426139	a novel frameshift mutation in the OMIM300842MESHC564038 gene in a japanese family. we report a novel mutation in the xk gene (xk) in a japanese patient with OMIM300842MESHC564038. a 50-year-old man showed progressive DOID767MESHD009133, OMIM118700MESHD002819, elevated level of serum creatinine kinase, and OMIM200100MESHD000012. the expression level of all the kell antigens in erythrocyte was decreased and molecular analysis revealed a single-base (t) deletion at the nucleotide position 1095 in xk. this deletion caused a frameshift in translation, leading to a premature stop codon at the amino acid position 408. we conclude this single-base deletion causes defective kx protein, which is responsible for the OMIM300842MESHC564038 in this patient.. 
10330430	alpha-cardiac actin is a novel DOID4MESHD004194 gene in familial hypertrophic DOID0050700MESHD009202. we identified the alpha-cardiac actin gene (actc) as a novel DOID4MESHD004194 gene in a pedigree suffering from familial hypertrophic DOID0050700MESHD009202 (OMIM143890DOID13810). linkage analyses excluded all the previously reported OMIM143890DOID13810 loci as possible DOID4MESHD004194 loci in the family studied, with lod scores varying between -2. 5 and -6. 0 0. further linkage analyses of plausible candidate genes highly expressed in the adult human heart identified actc as the most likely DOID4MESHD004194 gene, showing a maximal lod score of 3. 6 6. mutation analysis of actc revealed an ala295ser mutation in exon 5 close to 2 missense mutations recently described to cause the inherited form of idiopathic DOID12930OMIM115200OMIM613424OMIM613642MESHD002311 (idc). 
8084618	the ews gene, involved in ewing family of DOID162MESHD009369, malignant DOID4233MESHD018227 and desmoplastic small round cell DOID162MESHD009369, codes for an rna binding protein with novel regulatory domains. the ews gene, which maps to band q12 of human chromosome 22, is involved in a wide variety of human solid DOID162MESHD009369 including ewing DOID1115DOID4235DOID6193MESHD012509, related DOID0050902DOID4790DOID4794DOID7398MESHD018242, malignant DOID4233MESHD018227 and desmoplastic small round cell DOID162MESHD009369. in these DOID162MESHD009369, the ews is fused to genes encoding transcriptional activators/repressors, like fli-1 or erg or atf 1 or OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396. to better understand the function of the ews protein, we cloned the ews cdna. sequence analysis of this cdna revealed differential splicing involving two exons encoding 72 amino acids. both alternatively spliced transcripts, ews and ews-b, are expressed in a variety of cells. because ews proteins contain putative conserved rna binding motifs, we studied the rna binding properties of the ews protein. the ews-b protein binds to rna in vitro and, specifically, to poly g and poly u. the rna binding activity was localized to the carboxy terminal 86 amino acids, which constitute rgg box. thus the amino terminal domain of ews (OMIM182940MESHD009436-ews), which is involved in chromosome translocation may regulate the specificity of rna binding activity of ews. an ews-erg chimeric protein, which is found in DOID3369OMIM612219MESHD012512 cells, functions as a transcriptional activator. mutational analysis of ews-erg chimeric protein revealed that OMIM182940MESHD009436-ews functions as a regulatory domain for the transcriptional activation properties of ews-erg chimeric protein.. 
1301938	a mutation common in non-jewish OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661: frequency and rna studies. OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 (OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661) is an autosomal recessive DOID630MESHD030342 resulting from mutation of the hexa gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme, beta-n-acetylhexosaminidase a (hex a). we have discovered that a tay-sachs mutation, ivs-9 + 1 g-- > a, first detected by akli et al. (genomics 11  124-134, 1991), is a common DOID4MESHD004194 allele in non-jewish caucasians (10/58 alleles examined). a pcr-based diagnostic test, which detects an nlaiii site generated by the mutation, revealed a frequency among enzyme-defined carriers of 9/64 (14%). most of those carrying the allele trace their origins to the united kingdom, ireland, or western europe. it was not identified among 12 black american OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 alleles or in any of 18 ashkenazi jewish, enzyme-defined carriers who did not carry any of the mutations common to this population. no normally spliced rna was detected in pcr products generated from reverse transcription of rna carrying the ivs-9 mutation. instead, the low levels of mrna from this allele were comprised of aberrant species resulting from the use of either of two cryptic donor sites, one truncating exon 9 and the other within ivs-9, spliced to exon 10. numerous additional splice products were detected, most involving skipping of one or more surrounding exons. together with a recently identified allele responsible for hex a pseudodeficiency (triggs-raine et al. am j hum genet, 1992), these two alleles accounted for almost 50% (29/64) of OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 or carrier alleles ascertained by enzyme screening tests in non-jewish caucasians.. 
1302022	characterization of the OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 region predicts multiple protein isoform-encoding mrnas. the mutation underlying OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) has been identified as an expansion of a polymorphic ctg-repeat in a gene encoding protein kinase activity. brain and heart transcripts of the dm-kinase (dmr-b15) gene are subject to alternative rna splicing in both human and mouse. the unstable [ctg] 5-30 motif is found uniquely in humans, although the flanking nucleotides are also present in mouse. characterization of the dm region of both species reveals another active gene (dmr-n9) in close proximity to the kinase gene. dmr-n9 transcripts, mainly expressed in brain and testis, possess a single, large open reading frame, but the function of its protein product is unknown. clinical manifestation of dm may be caused by the expanded ctg-repeat compromising the (alternative) expression of dm-kinase or dmr-n9 proteins.. 
2310692	paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria with coexisting deficiency of the ninth component of complement: lack of massive haemolytic attack. a 47-year-old woman with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (pnh) was found to have an inherited deficiency in the ninth complement component (c9). in complement-sensitivity lysis tests, 80% of her erythrocytes were markedly complement-sensitive (pnh-iii). laser cytofluorimetry with a monoclonal antibody against decay-accelerating factor (daf) revealed that 95% of her erythrocytes were daf-negative. surprisingly, she has suffered only mild MESHD006461 and has never experienced massive spontaneous MESHD006461. gross haemoglobinuria and MESHD007565 occurred only after receiving postoperative transfusion of whole blood. in her serum, c9 was not detectable either by immunological or by functional assays. both the OMIM159580DOID321MESHD015493 test and the sugar water test using normal human serum or plasma yielded marked MESHD006461 of the patients erythrocytes. when the patients serum or plasma was used, only a trace of lysis was detected. addition of purified human c9 to her plasma fully restored MESHD006461. these observations indicated that c9 may play a critical role in haemolytic attacks in patients with pnh and that characteristic MESHD006461 in pnh may be tempered by coexisting OMIM613825MESHC565165.. 
10943845	brca1 is associated with a human swi/snf-related complex: linking chromatin remodeling to OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943. germline mutations in the DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor gene, brca1, predispose individuals to breast and DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051. using a combination of affinity- and conventional chromatographic techniques, we have isolated a predominant form of a multiprotein brca1-containing complex from human cells displaying chromatin-remodeling activity. mass spectrometric sequencing of components of this complex indicated that brca1 is associated with a swi/snf-related complex. we show that brca1 can directly interact with the brg1 subunit of the swi/snf complex. moreover, p53-mediated stimulation of transcription by brca1 was completely abrogated by either a dominant-negative mutant of brg1 or the DOID162MESHD009369-causing deletion in exon 11 of brca1. these findings reveal a direct function for brca1 in transcriptional control through modulation of chromatin structure.. 
8375105	germinal mosaicism in a duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 family: implications for genetic counselling. in this study we describe a three-generation family in which two siblings were affected by duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388). immunohistochemical analysis of muscle dystrophin and haplotype analysis of the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 locus revealed that the x chromosome carrying the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene was transmitted from the healthy maternal grandfather to his three daughters, including the probands mother. these findings indicate that the grandfather was a germinal mosaic for the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene. the definition of the carrier status in two possible carriers led us to give accurate genetic counselling and to prevent the birth of an affected boy. the results of this study demonstrate the usefulness of haplotype analysis and immunohistochemical muscle dystrophin studies to detect hidden germinal mosaicism and to improve genetic counselling.. 
10198641	centrosome amplification and a defective g2-m cell cycle checkpoint induce genetic instability in brca1 exon 11 isoform-deficient cells. germline mutations of the brca1 DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor gene predispose women to breast and DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051. to study mechanisms underlying brca1-related MESHD063646, we derived mouse embryonic fibroblast cells carrying a targeted deletion of exon 11 of the brca1 gene. we show that the mutant cells maintain an intact g1-s cell cycle checkpoint and proliferate poorly. however, a defective g2-m checkpoint in these cells is accompanied by extensive MESHD002869. mutant fibroblasts contain multiple, functional centrosomes, which lead to unequal chromosome segregation, abnormal nuclear division, and MESHD000782. these data uncover an essential role of brca1 in maintaining genetic stability through the regulation of centrosome duplication and the g2-m checkpoint and provide a molecular basis for the role of brca1 in MESHD063646.. 
1769645	aberrant splicing of phenylalanine hydroxylase mrna: the major cause for OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 in parts of southern europe. we report a mutation within the phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600) gene that causes aberrant splicing of the mrna and that is in tight association with chromosomal haplotypes 6, 10, and 36. because of the high frequency of these particular haplotypes in bulgaria, italy, and turkey, it appears to be one of the more frequent defects in the OMIM178600 gene causing classical OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 in this part of europe. the mutation is a g to a transition at position 546 in intron 10 of the OMIM178600 gene, 11 bp upstream from the intron 10/exon 11 boundary. it activates a cryptic splice site and results in an in-frame insertion of 9 nucleotides between exon 10 and exon 11 of the processed mrna. normal amounts of liver OMIM178600 protein are present in homozygous patients, but no catalytic activity can be detected. this loss of enzyme activity is probably caused by conformational changes resulting from the insertion of three additional amino acids (gly-leu-gln) between the normal sequences encoded by exon 10 and exon 11.. 
10814710	biochemical and structural analysis of missense mutations in n-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase causing DOID12798MESHD009083 OMIM243500DOID14753MESHC538167 phenotypes. DOID12798MESHD009083 OMIM243500DOID14753MESHC538167 (mps OMIM243500DOID14753MESHC538167; omim # 253000), a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of n -acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (galns), has variable clinical phenotypes. to date we have identified 65 missense mutations in the galns gene from mps OMIM243500DOID14753MESHC538167 patients, but the correlation between genotype and phenotype has remained unclear. we studied 17 missense mutations using biochemical approaches and 32 missense mutations, using structural analyses. fifteen missense mutations and two newly engineered active site mutations (c79s, c79t) were characterized by transient expression analysis. mutant proteins, except for c79s and c79t, were destabilized and detected as insoluble precursor forms while the c79s and c79t mutants were of a soluble mature size. mutants found in the severe phenotype had no activity. mutants found in the mild phenotype had a considerable residual activity (1. 3-13. 3% of wild-type galns activity). sulfatases, including galns, are members of a highly conserved gene family sharing an extensive sequence homology. thus, a tertiary structural model of human galns was constructed from the x-ray crystal structure of n -acetylgalacto-samine-4-sulfatase and arylsulfatase a, using homology modeling, and 32 missense mutations were investigated. consequently, we propose that there are at least three different reasons for the severe phenotype  (i) destruction of the hydrophobic core or modification of the packing; (ii) removal of a salt bridge to destabilize the entire conformation; (iii) modification of the active site. in contrast, mild mutations were mostly located on the surface of the galns protein. these studies shed further light on the genotype-phenotype correlation of mps OMIM243500DOID14753MESHC538167 and structure-function relationship in the sulfatase family.
7437512	OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923: cellular impairments and their implication for carrier detection. a family in which two male siblings were affected with OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 (was) was studied using g-6-pd isoenzymes as an x-linked marker in order to investigate the nature of cellular abnormalities. isolated peripheral blood cell types from the doubly heterozygous mother of the affected males seemingly failed to express the g-6-pd allele in cis position with the was allele while her cultured skin fibroblasts expressed both g-6-pd alleles. additionally, a histogram analysis of platelet size revealed a single population of abnormally small platelets in the affected propositus, whereas the heterozygous mother had no appreciable small platelet subpopulation. in vitro culture of hemopoietic progenitor cells of the heterozygous mother showed that the majority of progenitor cells did not express the was allele. however, a small number of cells expressing the g-6-pd type linked with the was allele were detected. the proportion of the latter progenitors was significantly higher among more primitive progenitors (those giving rise to later appearing colonies). this observation suggests that selection against cells expressing the wiskott-aldrich OMIM188560 takes place in the hemopoietic system of the heterozygous female and offers a possible means of carrier detection in some women. linkage studies in this family revealed one example of probable recombination between the loci for was and g-6-pd among three informative subjects, suggesting that these two loci may not be closely linked on the x-chromosome.. 
2792129	familial deficiency of the seventh component of complement associated with recurrent MESHD008589. we describe an 11-year-old girl suffering from recurrent DOID9471MESHD008581 with a complete absence of the seventh component of complement (c7). diagnosis was established by haemolytic titration and western blotting. the patients serum lacked the 85 kda c7 chain. haemolytic activity of serum was reconstituted with either pooled normal human serum or with purified c7. the relatives (parents and one sister) had half-normal levels of both immunochemically and functionally determined c7, indicating a heterozygous state for OMIM610102MESHC566443.. 
10190331	non-syndromic MESHD034381 associated with DOID0050332MESHC566366 is caused by OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648 mutations. DOID0050332MESHC566366 (eva), known as the most common form of inner ear abnormality, has recently been of particular genetic interest because this anomaly is inherited in a recessive manner. the locus for non-syndromic DOID10003MESHD006319 with eva has been mapped to the same chromosomal region, 7q31, as the OMIM274600DOID0060744MESHC536648 locus. in the present study, seven mutations in the OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648 gene (OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648), the gene responsible for OMIM274600DOID0060744MESHC536648, have been found in families of non-syndromic DOID10003MESHD006319 with eva. one family is homozygous, three families are compound heterozygotes, and two families are heterozygous but with no other mutation detected. the present results provide evidence that mutations in OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648 cause both syndromic and non-syndromic MESHD034381.. 
3480530	deletions of a dna sequence in DOID4648DOID768OMIM180200MESHD012175 and mesenchymal DOID162MESHD009369: organization of the sequence and its encoded protein. OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 is a childhood DOID162MESHD009369 that can arise because of mutant alleles acquired as somatic or germinal mutations. the mutant allele can be carried in the germ line. the mutations creating these alleles act by inactivating copies of a recessive oncogene located within band q14 of chromosome 13 and termed the OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 locus. we have reported isolation of a cdna fragment that recognizes chromosomal sequences possessing many of the attributes of the OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 gene associated with the OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 locus. we now report that this segment is additionally the target of somatic mutations in mesenchymal DOID162MESHD009369 among patients having no apparent predisposition to OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 and no previous evidence of OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175. these DOID162MESHD009369 provide additional evidence that the cloned sequences are representative of a gene that is a frequent target of inactivation during MESHD063646. sequence analysis of this cdna provides little insight into its normal functional role.. 
2862466	genetically determined low c4: a predisposing factor to autoimmune chronic active DOID2237MESHD006505. of 26 patients with autoimmune chronic active DOID2237MESHD006505 (cah) starting in childhood 18 (69%) had low c4 and 5 (19%) had low c3 serum levels. impaired hepatic synthesis and immune-consumption were unlikely since transferrin levels were normal in all patients, albumin levels were persistently low in only 3, and only 3 had raised levels of activation fragment OMIM613779MESHC565169. c4d was normal in all patients studied. in the families of 12 probands with low c4, 7 parents had low c4 and 2 had levels which were at the lower limit of normal. 5 of 10 siblings from 5 families had low c4. these results suggest that low c4 levels in cah are genetically determined. c4 phenotyping in 20 patients and in 26 parents showed that 90% and 81%, respectively, had null allotypes at either the c4a or c4b locus compared with 59% in controls, indicating that defective expression of structural genes may contribute to the observed c4 deficiency.. 
3417303	tight linkage between OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 and apolipoprotein e genes revealed with allele-specific oligonucleotides. in 16 families with OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) a novel approach based on use of allele-specific oligonucleotides has been employed to study the linkage relationship between the apolipoprotein e (apoe) gene and dm. synthetic oligonucleotides, designed to discriminate between apoe alleles epsilon 3 and epsilon 4, enabled us to distinguish heterozygous carriers in a hybridization assay. in a subset of families, the relevant segment of the apoe gene was enzymatically amplified to increase the sensitivity of the method. for dm and apoe, a maximum lod score (zmax of 7. 47 was obtained at a recombination frequency (theta) of 0. 047 (male theta = female theta). no recombination (maximum lod score of 5. 61 at theta = 0. 0) was found between apoe and the apolipoprotein cii (apoc2) gene. these results suggest that, in addition to apoc2, apoe is a useful marker for presymptomatic dm diagnosis.
7894493	confirmation of brca1 by analysis of germline mutations linked to breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 in ten families. we provide genetic evidence supporting the identity of the candidate gene for brca1 through the characterization of germline mutations in 63 OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 patients and 10 OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 patients in ten families with DOID162MESHD009369 linked to chromosome 17q21. nine different mutations were detected by screening brca1 dna and rna by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. seven mutations lead to protein truncations at sites throughout the gene. one missense mutation (which occurred independently in two families) leads to loss of a cysteine in the zinc binding domain. an intronic single basepair substitution destroys an acceptor site and activates a cryptic splice site, leading to a 59 basepair insertion and chain termination. the four families with both breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 had chain termination mutations in the n-terminal half of the protein.. 
7937795	genetic instability in human OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 cell lines. we have analyzed the stability of microsatellites in cell lines derived from human DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051 and found that 5 out of 10 of the ovarian DOID162MESHD009369 cell lines are genetically unstable at the majority of the loci analyzed. in clones and subclones derived serially from one of these cell lines (2774; DOID3114MESHD018284), a very high proportion of microsatellites distributed in many different regions of the genome change their size in a mercurial fashion. we conclude that MESHD042822 in ovarian DOID162MESHD009369 is a dynamic and ongoing process whose high frequency may have been previously underestimated by pcr-based allelotyping of bulk DOID162MESHD009369 tissue. we have identified the source of the genetic instability in one ovarian DOID162MESHD009369 as a point mutation (r524p) in the human mismatch-repair gene msh2 (salmonella muts homologue), which has recently been shown to be involved in hereditary nonpolyposis OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179. patient 2774 was a 38-year-old heterozygote, and her normal tissue carried both mutant and wild-type alleles of the human msh2 gene. however the wild-type allele was lost at some point early during MESHD063646 so that dna isolated either from the patients ovarian DOID162MESHD009369 or from the 2774 cell line carries only the mutant allele of the human msh2 gene. the genetic instability observed in the DOID162MESHD009369 and cell line dna, together with the germ-line mutation in a mismatch-repair gene, suggest that the msh2 gene is involved in the onset and/or progression in a subset of OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051.. 
3455778	retroviral-mediated gene transfer of human phenylalanine hydroxylase into nih 3t3 and OMIM114550DOID684MESHD006528 cells. OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 (OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661) is caused by deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600). a full-length human OMIM178600 cdna sequence has been inserted into pzip-neosv (x), which is a retroviral vector containing the bacterial neo gene. the recombinant has been transfected into psi 2 cells, which provide synthesis of the retroviral capsid. recombinant virus was detected in the culture medium of the transfected psi 2 cells, which is capable of transmitting the human OMIM178600 gene into mouse nih 3t3 cells by MESHD007239 leading to stable incorporation of the recombinant provirus. infected cells express OMIM178600 mrna, immunoreactive OMIM178600 protein, and exhibit pterin-dependent phenylalanine hydroxylase activity. the recombinant virus is also capable of infecting a mouse OMIM114550DOID684MESHD006528 cell line that does not normally synthesize OMIM178600. OMIM178600 activity is present in the cellular extracts and the entire hydroxylation system is reconstituted in the OMIM114550DOID684MESHD006528 cells infected with the recombinant viruses. thus, recombinant viruses containing human OMIM178600 cdna provide a means for introducing functional OMIM178600 into mammalian cells of hepatic origin and can potentially be introduced into whole animals as a model for somatic gene therapy for OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661.. 
7599636	characterisation of molecular defects in x-linked DOID2187MESHD000567 (OMIM301200DOID0110058MESHC538243). amelogenins are an heterogenous family of proteins produced by ameloblasts of the enamel organ during tooth development. disturbances of enamel formation occur in DOID2187MESHD000567, a clinically heterogenous group of inherited disorders characterised by defective enamel biomineralisation. an amelogenin gene, amgx, has been mapped to the short of the x chromosome (xp22. 1-p22. 3) and has been implicated in the molecular pathology of x-linked DOID2187MESHD000567 (OMIM301200DOID0110058MESHC538243). we have identified three families exhibiting OMIM301200DOID0110058MESHC538243 and screened the amgx gene for mutations using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and dna sequencing. three novel mutations were identified  a c-t substitution in exon 5, and a g-t substitution and single cytosine deletion in exon 6, confirming the existence of extensive allelic heterogeneity in this condition. the identification of family-specific mutations will enable early identification of affected individuals and correlation of clinical phenotype with genotype will facilitate an objective system of DOID4MESHD004194 classification. 
10192399	the OMIM274600DOID0060744MESHC536648 gene encodes a chloride-iodide transport protein. OMIM274600DOID0060744MESHC536648 is the most common form of syndromic MESHD003638 and characterized by congenital DOID10003MESHD006319 and DOID12176. this disorder was mapped to chromosome 7 and the gene causing OMIM274600DOID0060744MESHC536648 (OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648) was subsequently identified by positional cloning. OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648 encodes a putative transmembrane protein designated pendrin. pendrin is closely related to a family of sulfate transport proteins that includes the rat sulfate-anion transporter (encoded by sat-1; 29% amino acid sequence identity), the human OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170 sulfate transporter (encoded by OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170; 32%) and the human sulfate transporter downregulated in DOID657DOID3172DOID5403DOID6204MESHD000236 (encoded by dra; 45%). on the basis of this homology and the presence of a slightly modified sulfate-transporter signature sequence comprising its putative second transmembrane domain, pendrin has been proposed to function as a sulfate transporter. we were unable to detect evidence of sulfate transport following the expression of pendrin in xenopus laevis oocytes by microinjection of OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648 crna or in sf9 cells following MESHD007239 with OMIM274600OMIM600510DOID0060680MESHC563184DOID0060744MESHC536648-recombinant baculovirus. the rates of transport for iodide and chloride were significantly increased following the expression of pendrin in both cell systems. our results demonstrate that pendrin functions as a transporter of chloride and iodide, but not sulfate, and may provide insight into thyroid physiology and the pathophysiology of OMIM274600DOID0060744MESHC536648.. 
161677	linkage relationship of OMIM217000DOID0060295, hla and glyoxalase i loci. immunogenetic analysis of a homozygous c2-deficient individual and family members demonstrated linkage of hla-a25, b18 and c2o. hla-d typing showed that 5 members typed with homozygous dw2 typing cells from an individual with OMIM217000DOID0060295 but not with dw2 typing cells from 2 individuals with normal c2. the homozygous c2-deficient propositus and brother were hla-a and b homozygous but heterozygous at the hla-d and glyoxalase i loci. therefore, in this family, the c2o gene is linked with two distinct haplotypes  hla-a25, b18, dw2, glo1 and hla-a25, b18, d unknown, gl02. these results could be explained by an ancestral recombinant event, which occurred between the c2o locus and hla-d locus in which c2o segregated with hla-b. this would suggest that the locus for the c2o gene maps between hla-b and hla-d on the sixth chromosome.. 
1319059	a 71-kilodalton protein is a major product of the duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 gene in brain and other nonmuscle tissues. the known duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) gene products, the muscle- and brain-type dystrophin isoforms, are 427-kda proteins translated from 14-kilobase (kb) mrnas. recently we described a 6. 5-kb mrna that also is transcribed from the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene. cloning and in vitro transcription and translation of the entire coding region show that the 6. 5-kb mrna encodes a 70. 8-kda protein that is a major product of the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene. it contains the c-terminal and the cysteine-rich domains of dystrophin, seven additional amino acids at the n terminus, and some modifications formed by alternative splicing in the c-terminal domain. it lacks the entire large domain of spectrin-like repeats and the actin-binding n-terminal domain of dystrophin. this protein is the major OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene product in brain and other nonmuscle tissues but is undetectable in skeletal muscle extracts.
1146783	OMIM235800DOID0060168MESHC538320. classical and atypical form in siblings. two brothers, 6 and 13 years old, had OMIM235800DOID0060168MESHC538320. on the basis of clinical and biochemical observations, the younger boy was considered to have a classical type of the DOID4MESHD004194, while the older boy had an atypical form characterized by partial impairment of the skin histidase activity and a moderately prolonged half-life of blood histidine. the mother is a heterozygous carrier, while the father and sister seem to be normal.. 
1937471	DOID1919: analysis of hprt mutations by direct sequencing and allele-specific amplification. the OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926 is a severe x chromosome-linked human DOID4MESHD004194 caused by a virtual absence of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) activity. a partial deficiency in the activity of this enzyme can result in DOID13189MESHD015210. to determine the genetic basis for reduction or loss of enzyme activity, we have amplified and sequenced the coding region of hprt cdna from four patients  one with OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926 (hprtperth) and three with partial deficiencies of hprt activity, which have been designated hprturangan, hprtswan and hprttoowong. in all four patients, the only mutation identified was a single base substitution in exons 2 or 3 of the coding region, which in each case predicts a single amino acid substitution in the translated protein. each base change was confirmed by allele-specific amplification of the patients genomic dna. it is interesting to note that the mutation found for hprtperth is identical to that reported for hprtflint. it appears that the two mutations are de novo events.. 
3343337	OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111. impaired fatty alcohol oxidation in cultured fibroblasts due to deficient fatty alcohol:nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidoreductase activity. lipid metabolism was studied in cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with the inherited disorder, OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 (OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111). intact OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 fibroblasts incubated in the presence of [1-14c] palmitate accumulated more radioactive hexadecanol than did normal cells, whereas incorporation of radioactivity into other cellular lipids was unaltered. the hexadecanol content of OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 fibroblasts was abnormally elevated. hexadecanol accumulation was not due to increased fatty alcohol synthesis nor its deficient utilization for glycerol ether synthesis. the half-life of intracellular hexadecanol loaded into OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 fibroblasts was increased (70 min) compared with normal (15 min), and intact OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 fibroblasts showed impaired oxidation of [14c] -hexadecanol to fatty acid. fatty alcohol  OMIM257150 + oxidoreductase, the enzyme catalyzing this reaction, was deficient in OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 fibroblasts. mean total activity in OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 fibroblasts (n = 5) was 13% of that in normal fibroblasts, and palmitoyl coa-inhibitable activity was 1% of normal. fibroblasts from two obligate OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 heterozygotes had enzyme activities intermediate between that in normal fibroblasts and individuals with OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111. these results suggest that the primary OMIM188560 in OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 is deficiency of fatty alcohol  OMIM257150 + oxidoreductase. OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 represents the first inherited disorder in man associated with an isolated abnormality in fatty alcohol metabolism.. 
10736265	glycerol as a correlate of DOID10603MESHD018149: dissection of a complex system by use of a simple genetic trait. glycerol kinase (gk) represents the primary entry of glycerol into glucose and triglyceride metabolism. DOID10603MESHD018149 (igt) and MESHD015228 are associated with an increased risk of DOID9351MESHD003920 and DOID1287MESHD002318. the relationship between glycerol and the risk of igt, however, is poorly understood. we therefore undertook the study of fasting plasma glycerol levels in a cohort of 1, 056 unrelated men and women of french-canadian descent. family screening in the initial cohort identified 18 men from five families with severe OMIM307030DOID0060363 (values above 2. 0 mmol/liter) and demonstrated an x-linked pattern of inheritance. linkage analysis of the data from 12 microsatellite markers surrounding the xp21. 3 gk gene resulted in a peak lod score of 3. 46, centered around marker dxs8039. in addition, since all of the families originated in a population with a proven founder effect-the saguenay lac-st. -jean region of quebec-a common DOID4MESHD004194 haplotype was sought. indeed, a six-marker haplotype extending over a region of 5. 5 cm was observed in all families. resequencing of the gk gene in family members led to the discovery of a n288d missense mutation in exon 10, which resulted in the substitution of a highly conserved asparagine residue by a negatively charged aspartic acid. 
1505217	assignment of the aspartylglucosaminidase gene (OMIM109200) to 4q33----q35 based on decreased activity in a girl with a 46,xx,del(4)(q33) karyotype. OMIM208400DOID0050461MESHD054880 (OMIM208400MESHD054880) is a recessive autosomally inherited lysosomal storage disorder due to deficiency of the enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase (OMIM109200). the structural gene for this human enzyme (OMIM109200) has been assigned to the region 4q21----qter. we determined the OMIM109200 activity in cultured fibroblasts of a girl with a 46, xx, del (4) (q33) karyotype. the results indicate that the girl is a hemizygote for OMIM109200, permitting the assignment of human OMIM109200 to the region 4q33----qter.. 
10891444	mutations in the fibrinogen aalpha gene account for the majority of cases of congenital DOID2236OMIM202400MESHD000347. congenital DOID2236OMIM202400MESHD000347 is a rare, autosomal, recessive disorder characterized by the complete absence of detectable fibrinogen. we previously identified the first causative mutations in a nonconsanguineous swiss family; the 4 affected persons have homozygous deletions of approximately 11 kb of the fibrinogen alpha (fga) gene. haplotype data implied that these deletions occurred on distinct ancestral chromosomes, suggesting that this region may be susceptible to deletion by a common mechanism. we subsequently showed that all the deletions were identical to the base pair and probably resulted from a nonhomologous recombination mediated by 7-bp direct repeats. in this study, we have collected data on 13 additional unrelated patients to identify the causative mutations and to determine the prevalence of the 11-kb deletion. a common recurrent mutation, at the donor splice site of fga intron 4 (ivs4 + 1 g > t), accounted for 14 of the 26 (54%) alleles. one patient was heterozygous for the previously identified deletion. three more frameshift mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, and a second splice site mutation were also identified. consequently, 86% of DOID2236OMIM202400MESHD000347 alleles analyzed to date have truncating mutations of fga, though mutations in all 3 fibrinogen genes, fgg, fga, and fgb, might be predicted to cause congenital DOID2236OMIM202400MESHD000347.. 
523196	utilization of purines by an hprt variant in an intelligent, nonmutilative patient with features of the OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926. the patient, h. OMIM118840OMIM214100. b., was among the first reported with DOID1920MESHD033461 and central nervous system symptoms. he has been found to have a variant of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt; e. c. 2. 4. 2. 8) distinct from the enzyme present in patients with the OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926. the patient had chroeoathetosis, spasticity, dysarthric speech, and DOID1920MESHD033461. however, his intelligence was normal and he had no evidence of self-mutilation. there was no activity of hprt in the lysates of erythrocytes and cultured fibroblasts when analyzed in the usual manner. using a newly developed method for the study of purine metabolism in intact cultured cells, this patient was found to metabolize some 9% of 8-14c-hypoxanthine, and 90% of the isotope utilized was converted to adenine and guanine nucleotides. in contrast, cells from patients with the OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926 were virtually completely unable to convert hypoxanthine to nucleotides. the patients fibroblasts were even more efficient in the metabolism of 8-14c-guanine, which was utilized to the extent of 27%, over 80% of which was converted to guanine and adenine nucleotides. the growth of the cultured fibroblasts of this patient was intermediate in media containing hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine (hat), whereas the growth of lesch-nyhan cells was inhibited and normal cells grew normally. similarly in 8-azaguanine, 6-thioguanine, and 8-azahypoxanthine, the growth of the patients cells was intermediate between normal and lesch-nyhan cells. these observations provide further evidence for genetic heterogeneity among patients with disorders in purine metabolism involving the hprt gene. they document that this famous patient did not have the OMIM300322DOID1919MESHD007926 
8023850	OMIM271900DOID3613MESHD017825: mutations among jewish and non-jewish patients. OMIM271900DOID3613MESHD017825 is an autosomal recessive DOID10579 caused by the deficiency of aspartoacylase (aspa). sixty-four probands were analyzed for mutations in the aspa gene. three point mutations--693c-- > a, 854a-- > c, and 914c-- > a--were identified in the coding sequence. the 693c-- > a and 914c-- > a base changes, resulting in nonsense tyr231-- > ter and missense ala305-- > glu mutations, respectively, lead to complete loss of aspa activity in in vitro expression studies. the 854a-- > c transversion converted glu to ala in codon 285. the glu285-- > ala mutant aspa has 2. 5% of the activity expressed by the wild-type enzyme. a fourth mutation, 433 --2 (a-- > g) transition, was identified at the splice-acceptor site in intron 2. the splice-site mutation would lead to skipping of exon 3, accompanied by a frameshift, and thus would produce aberrant aspa. of the 128 unrelated canavan chromosomes analyzed, 88 were from probands of ashkenazi jewish descent. the glu285-- > ala mutation was predominant (82. 9%) in this population, followed by the tyr231-- > ter (14. 8%) and 433 --2 (a-- > g) (1. 1%) mutations. the three mutations account for 98. 8% of the canavan chromosomes of ashkenazi jewish origin. the ala305-- > glu mutation was found exclusively in non-jewish probands of european descent and constituted 60% of the 40 mutant chromosomes. predominant occurrence of certain mutations among ashkenazi jewish and non-jewish patients with OMIM271900DOID3613MESHD017825 would suggest a founding-father effect in propagation of these mutant chromosomes 
1678319	identification of deletion mutations and three new genes at the familial polyposis locus. small (100-260 kb), nested deletions were characterized in dna from two unrelated patients with familial DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125). three candidate genes located within the deleted region were ascertained and a previous candidate gene, mcc, was shown to be located outside the deleted region. one of the new genes contained sequence identical to srp19, the gene coding for the 19 kd component of the ribosomal signal recognition particle. the second, provisionally designated dp1 (deleted in polyposis 1), was found to be transcribed in the same orientation as mcc. two other cdnas, dp2 and dp3, were found to overlap, forming a single gene, dp2. 5, that is transcribed in the same orientation as srp19. 
10830910	genotype-phenotype correlations in families with deletions in the von hippel-lindau (OMIM193300) gene. von hippel-lindau (OMIM193300) DOID4MESHD004194 is a hereditary DOID162MESHD009369 DOID225MESHD013577 characterized by predisposition for bilateral and multi-centric DOID5241MESHD018325 in the retina and central nervous system, OMIM171300DOID0050771MESHD010673, DOID4450DOID4464DOID4465DOID4467DOID4471DOID4473OMIM144700OMIM300854OMIM605074MESHD002292, and MESHD003560 in the kidney, pancreas, and epididymis. we describe five families for which direct sequencing of the coding region of the OMIM193300 gene had failed to identify the family-specific mutation. further molecular analysis revealed deletions involving the OMIM193300 gene in each of these families. in four families, partial deletions of one or more exons were detected by southern blot analysis. in the fifth family, fish analysis demonstrated the deletion of the entire OMIM193300 gene. our results show that (quantitative) southern blot analysis is a sensitive method for detecting germline deletions of the OMIM193300 gene and should be implemented in routine dna diagnosis for OMIM193300 DOID4MESHD004194. our data support the previously established observation that families with a germline deletion have a low risk for OMIM171300DOID0050771MESHD010673. further unraveling of genotype-phenotype correlations in OMIM193300 DOID4MESHD004194 has revealed that families with a full or partial deletion of the OMIM193300 gene exhibit a phenotype with a preponderance of central nervous system DOID5241MESHD018325.. 
10767313	understanding the molecular basis of OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600. OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600, a common form of inherited DOID1059MESHD008607, is mainly caused by massive expansion of cgg triplet repeats located in the 5-untranslated region of the fragile x DOID1059MESHD008607-1 (fmr1) gene. in patients with OMIM300624DOID14261OMIM309548MESHD005600, the expanded cgg triplet repeats are hypermethylated and the expression of the fmr1 gene is repressed, which leads to the absence of fmr1 protein (fmrp) and subsequent DOID1059MESHD008607. fmrp is an rna-binding protein that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. this protein has been implicated in protein translation as it is found associated with polyribosomes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum. we discuss here the recent progress made towards understanding the molecular mechanism of cgg repeat expansion and physiological function (s) of fmrp. these studies will not only help to illuminate the molecular basis of the general class of human DOID4MESHD004194MESHC with trinucleotide repeat expansion but also provide an avenue to understand aspects of human cognition and intelligence.. 
7076260	DOID2862MESHD005955 in papua new guinea. the description of 13 new variants. a total of 362 males from various regions of papua new guinea were screened for red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) activity. twenty-six g6pd deficient individuals were identified. biochemical characterization of g6pd purified from these subjects has revealed 13 new variants and several copies of previously described forms of g6pd. this study illustrates the extreme heterogeneity of DOID2862MESHD005955 among the people of papua new guinea.. 
3862128	regional mapping of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and the OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 locus in the human genome. OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 (OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661) is an autosomal recessive disorder of amino acid metabolism caused by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600; phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, ec 1. 14. 16. 1). a cdna clone for human OMIM178600 has previously been used to assign the corresponding gene to human chromosome 12. to define the regional map position of the DOID4MESHD004194 locus and the OMIM178600 gene on human chromosome 12, dna was isolated from human-hamster somatic cell hybrids with various deletions of human chromosome 12 and was analyzed by southern blot analysis using the human cdna OMIM178600 clone as a hybridization probe. from these results, together with detailed biochemical and cytogenetic characterization of the hybrid cells, the region on chromosome 12 containing the human OMIM178600 gene has been defined as 12q14. 3----qter 3----qter. the OMIM178600 map position on chromosome 12 was further localized by in situ hybridization of 125i-labeled human OMIM178600 cdna to chromosomes prepared from a human lymphoblastoid cell line. results of these experiments demonstrated that the region on chromosome 12 containing the OMIM178600 gene and the OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 locus in man is 12q22----12q24. 1. these results not only provide a regionalized map position for a major human DOID4MESHD004194 locus but also can serve as a reference point for linkage analysis with other dna markers on human chromosome 12 
2390095	total deficiency of plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein in subjects homozygous and heterozygous for the intron 14 splicing OMIM188560. the molecular basis of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (cetp) deficiency was investigated in 4 unrelated cetp-deficient families. the high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels of the probands exceeded 150 mg/dl. the plasma of the probands was totally deficient in cetp activity and mass. the genomic dna of the patients was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using two oligonucleotide primers located in the intron 12 and 14 of the cetp gene, and the amplified products were directly sequenced. two patients were homozygous for a g-to-a change at the 5-splice donor site of the intron 14. the g-to-a change would cause impaired splicing of pre-messenger rna. the other two probands were heterozygous for the mutation, but totally lacked cetp. their lipoprotein patterns were also similar to those of the two homozygotes. thus, other genetic defects or metabolic factors influencing cetp expression are implicated. the data suggest that the g-to-a mutation may be common in human plasma OMIM143470DOID0111369MESHC564591. furthermore, there could be compound heterozygotes who totally lack plasma cetp and have lipoprotein profiles similar to those of homozygotes.. 
3876122	heterogeneity of type i DOID12531MESHD014842: evidence for a subgroup with an abnormal von willebrand factor. type i DOID12531MESHD014842 (vwd) is characterized by equally low plasma concentrations of von willebrand factor antigen (vwf  ag) and ristocetin cofactor (ricof) and by the presence of all vwf multimers in sodium dodecyl sulfate (OMIM260400MESHD000081003) -agarose gel electrophoresis. for 17 patients (13 kindreds) diagnosed with these criteria, we have studied the platelet contents of vwf  ag and ricof and the changes of these in plasma after ddavp infusion. platelet vwf  ag and ricof were normal in four kindreds (called " platelet normal " subgroup); following 1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin; plasma vwf  ag, ricof and the MESHD006470 time (bt) became normal. in six kindreds, platelet vwf  ag and ricof were equally low (platelet low); after ddavp, plasma vwf  ag and ricof remained low, and the bt was prolonged. in three additional kindreds, platelets contained normal concentrations of vwf  ag, but ricof was very low (platelet discordant); even though a complete set of multimers was found in plasma and platelets, there was a relatively small amount of large multimers. after ddavp, plasma vwf  ag became normal, but ricof remained low and the bt was very prolonged. these findings demonstrated that there can be an abnormal vwf (ricof less than vwf  ag) even in type i vwd, coexisting with a complete set of vwf multimers (platelet discordant); that the abnormal vwf can be shown more clearly in platelets than in plasma or else in plasma after ddavp infusion; and that ddavp normalizes the bt only in those patients with normal platelet levels of both vwf  ag and ricof (platelet normal).. 
1303171	characterization of a yac containing part or all of the OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 locus. it has been shown from pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) that the monoamine oxidase genes a and b (maoa & maob) and dxs7 loci are physically very close. we have therefore extended studies on their relationship through the characterisation of a 650 kb yac isolated using l1. 28 (recognising the dxs7 locus) as a probe. restriction mapping of the yac indicates that it contains both maoa and maob genes in addition to the dxs7 locus. the map derived from the yl1. 28-yac is compatible both with the map from an independently derived yac carrying maoa and b genes and with the long range genomic map for the region. a series of subclones prepared from a phage library (lambda dash ii) of the yac have been characterised and have been employed to determine the end point of the deletion of a OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 (ndp) patient who has been shown to lack both dxs7 and mao coding sequences. the pattern of retention of subclones in the deletion patient place the end point of the deletion within 30-130 kb of the proximal end of the yac. by combining the data with established recombination analysis, we provide evidence that all or part of the ndp lies in the interval of approximately 250kb within the yac.
8477262	identification of mutations in danish OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794 families. we have searched for mutations in the OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794 gene (OMIM231090OMIM303100MESHD015794DOID3590OMIM614293MESHD006828) in patients from 12 danish families in which OMIM231090OMIM303100MESHD015794DOID3590OMIM614293MESHD006828 is segregating. employing polymerase chain reaction (pcr), single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis, and direct dna sequencing, different mutations have been identified in 6 patients. all the mutations will interfere with the correct translation of the mrna predicting a truncated protein or no gene product at all.. 
10543403	g130v, a common OMIM229300MESHC565561 point mutation, appears to have arisen from a common founder. OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561 (OMIM229300MESHC565561) is the most common inherited MESHD001259. about 98% of mutant alleles have an expansion of a gaa trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the affected gene, OMIM229300MESHC565561. the other 2% are point mutations. of the 17 point mutations so far described, three appear to be more common. one of these is the g130v mutation in exon 4 of OMIM229300MESHC565561. g130v, when present with an expanded gaa repeat on the other allele, is associated with an atypical OMIM229300MESHC565561 phenotype. haplotype analysis was undertaken on the four families who have been described with this mutation. the results suggest a common founder for this mutation. although marked differences in extragenic marker haplotypes were seen in one family, similar intragenic haplotyping suggests the same mutation founder for this family with the differences explicable by two recombination events.. 
7605382	frequency of exon 15 missense mutation (442d:g) in cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene in hyperalphalipoproteinemic japanese subjects. cholesteryl ester transfer protein (cetp) transfers cholesteryl ester from high density lipoprotein (hdl) to apo b-containing lipoproteins. the DOID0111369MESHC564591 caused by OMIM143470DOID0111369MESHC564591 is fairly common in japan and one of the most common mutations in the cetp gene is the splicing OMIM188560 of the intron 14, the allelic frequency of which has been shown to be 0. 0049 in the japanese general population. recently, we have reported a missense mutation in exon 15 of the cetp gene (442d  g), showing a dominant effect on the cetp activity and hdl-cholesterol level. in the current study, we determined the frequency of this new mutation in japanese hyperalphalipoproteinemic (hdl-cholesterol > or = 100 mg/dl) subjects. a rapid and easy screening method for this new mutation was developed using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) -mediated site-directed mutagenesis. among 117 japanese hyperalphalipoproteinemic subjects (hdl-cholesterol; 116. 7 +/- 16. 5 mg/dl, mean +/- s. d.) without the intron 14 splice OMIM188560, three homozygotes (2. 5%) and 34 heterozygotes (29. 1%) were found to have the 442d  g mutation. the relative allelic frequency of this mutation was calculated to be 0. 17. one of the homozygotes for the 442d  g mutation was the patient previously described by us as having DOID0111369MESHC564591 with MESHD003318 and coronary DOID114MESHD006331. this was the first reported subject homozygous for the OMIM143470DOID0111369MESHC564591 who also demonstrated atherosclerotic symptoms. in homozygous subjects, cetp activity ranged from 37% to 62% of the normal value, which was consistent with the results obtained from the transient expression experiment previously reported; however, the specific activity of cetp was not as low as expected.

10071193	fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 2 (fhf2): gene structure, expression and mapping to the borjeson-forssman-lehmann DOID225MESHD013577 region in xq26 delineated by a duplication breakpoint in a OMIM301900DOID0050681MESHC536575-like patient. borjeson-forssman-lehmann DOID225MESHD013577 (OMIM301900DOID0050681MESHC536575) is a syndromal MESHD038901, which maps by linkage to the q26 region of the human x chromosome. we have identified a male patient with OMIM301900DOID0050681MESHC536575-like features and a duplication, 46, y, dup (x) (q26q28), inherited from his phenotypically normal mother. fluorescence in situ hybridisation using yeast artificial chromosome clones from xq26 localised the duplication breakpoint to an approximately 400-kb interval in the xq26. 3 region between dxs155 and dxs294/dxs730. database searches and analysis of available genomic dna sequence from the region revealed the presence of the fibroblast growth factor homologous factor gene, fhf2, within the duplication breakpoint interval. the gene structure of fhf2 was determined and two new exons were identified, including a new 5 end exon, 1b. fhf2 is a large gene extending over approximately 200 kb in xq26. 3 and is composed of at least seven exons. it shows tissue-specific alternative splicing and alternative transcription starts. northern blot hybridisation showed highest expression in brain and skeletal muscle. the fhf2 gene localisation and tissue-specific expression pattern suggest it to be a candidate gene for familial cases of the OMIM301900DOID0050681MESHC536575 DOID225MESHD013577 and other syndromal and non-specific forms of MESHD038901 mapping to the region.
8098245	illegitimate transcription of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in lymphocytes for identification of mutations in OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661. taking advantage of the illegitimate transcription of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600) gene, we have been able to analyse the OMIM178600 cdna sequence of hyperphenylalaninemic children in circulating lymphocytes. using this approach, we have also identified 3 novel mutations in cdna from liver and lymphocytes of two patients. one mutation, detected by the abnormal pattern of migration of an amplified fragment, is a c to t transition in the splice acceptor site of intron 10, which resulted in the skipping of exon 11 with the premature termination of rna translation downstream from exon 12 (-3 ivs10). the other two mutations are missense mutations in exons 10 and 11 (respectively, l333f and e390g). the present study supports the view that circulating lymphocytes give easy access to OMIM178600 gene transcripts whose nucleotide sequence is identical to that reported in liver and therefore represent a useful tool for molecular genetic studies in OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661.. 
10958786	function of an axonal chemoattractant modulated by metalloprotease activity. the axonal chemoattractant netrin-1 guides spinal commissural axons by activating its receptor dcc (deleted in OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 ). we have found that chemical inhibitors of metalloproteases potentiate netrin-mediated axon outgrowth in vitro. we have also found that dcc is a substrate for metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding, and that the inhibitors block proteolytic processing of dcc and cause an increase in dcc protein levels on axons within spinal OMIM120970DOID0111005 explants. thus, potentiation of netrin activity by inhibitors may result from stabilization of dcc on the axons, and proteolytic activity may regulate axon migration by controlling the number of functional extracellular axon guidance receptors.. 
2886237	OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794: close linkage to dxys1 and dxys12 demonstrated by segregation analysis and historical-genealogical evidence. linkage studies using restriction fragment length polymorphisms were conducted in the x-linked disorder, OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794, designated OMIM303100 for progressive tapeto-choroidal dystrophy. previously demonstrated close linkage with locus dxys1 was confirmed (lod 11. 44 at 0 recombination distance). in addition, locus dxys12 was found to be closely linked with OMIM303100 (lod 3. 31 at 0 recombination distance). the DOID4MESHD004194 mainly occurs in three large kindreds in remote northern finland. while formal genealogical proof is lacking, all presently living (more than 80 affected males and 120 carrier females) probably originate from a common founder couple born in 1644 and 1646, twelve generations ago. all 36 patients and 48 carriers tested from the three kindreds had the same haplotype (OMIM303100/dxys1, 11kb/dxys12, 1. 6kb). given that at least 105 female meioses transmitting OMIM303100 have occurred since 1650 in these kindreds, extremely close linkage between OMIM303100, dxys1 and dxys12 is suggested. the above haplotype is a very useful diagnostic tool in these OMIM303100 families. we suggest that our historical-genealogical approach to linkage analysis may be possible elsewhere in similar isolated populations 
10369870	functional consequences of mutations in the early growth response 2 gene (egr2) correlate with severity of human myelinopathies. the early growth response 2 gene (egr2) is a cys2his2zinc finger transcription factor which is thought to play a role in the regulation of peripheral nervous system myelination. this idea is based partly on the phenotype of homozygous krox20 (egr2) knockout mice, which display hypomyelination of the pns and a block of schwann cells at an early stage of differentiation. mutations in the human egr2 gene have recently been associated with the inherited MESHD010523 charcot-marie-tooth type 1, OMIM145900DOID0050540DOID2477MESHD015417 and congenital hypomyelinating DOID870. three of the four egr2 mutations are dominant and occur within the zinc finger dna-binding domain. the fourth mutation is recessive and affects the inhibitory domain (r1) that binds the nab transcriptional co-repressors. a combination of dna-binding assays and transcriptional analysis was used to determine the functional consequences of these mutations. the zinc finger mutations affect dna binding and the amount of residual binding directly correlates with DOID4MESHD004194 severity. the r1 domain mutation prevents interaction of egr2 with the nab co-repressors and thereby increases transcriptional activity. these data provide insight into the possible DOID4MESHD004194 mechanisms underlying egr2 mutations and the reason for varying severity and differences in inheritance patterns.. 
2786201	molecular basis of human DOID12531MESHD014842: analysis of platelet von willebrand factor mrna. DOID12531MESHD014842 (vwd), the most common inherited MESHD006470 disorder in humans, can result from either a quantitative or a qualitative OMIM188560 in the adhesive glycoprotein, von willebrand factor (vwf). molecular studies of vwd have been limited by the large size of the vwf gene and difficulty in obtaining the vwf mrna from patients. by use of an adaptation of the polymerase chain reaction, vwf mrna was amplified and sequenced from peripheral blood platelets. a silent vwf allele was identified, resulting from a cis OMIM188560 in vwf mrna transcription or processing. in two type iia vwd patients, two different but adjacent missense mutations were identified, the locations of which may identify an important vwf functional domain. expression in heterologous cells of recombinant vwf containing one of these latter mutations reproduced the characteristic structural abnormality seen in type iia vwd plasma.. 
10430930	a transgene insertion creating a heritable MESHD002872 mouse model of prader-willi and angelman DOID225MESHD013577. OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218) and OMIM105830DOID1932MESHD017204 (as) result from the loss of function of imprinted genes in human chromosome 15q11-q13. the central part of mouse chromosome 7 is homologous to human 15q11-q13, with conservation of both gene order and imprinted features. we report here the characterization of a transgene insertion (epstein-barr virus latent membrane protein 2a, lmp2a) into mouse chromosome 7c, which has resulted in mouse models for OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 and as dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent. epigenotype (allelic expression and dna methylation) and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses indicate that the transgene-induced mutation has generated a complete deletion of the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218/as-homologous region but has not deleted flanking loci. because the intact chromosome 7, opposite the deleted homolog, maintains the correct imprint in somatic cells of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 and as mice and establishes the correct imprint in male and female germ cells of as mice, homologous association and replication asynchrony are not part of the imprinting mechanism. this heritable-deletion mouse model will be particularly useful for the identification of the etiological genes and mechanisms, phenotypic basis, and investigation of therapeutic approaches for OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218.. 
10747931	transgenic mice expressing a truncated form of the high mobility group i-c protein develop adiposity and an abnormally high prevalence of DOID10192DOID3315MESHD008067. MESHD014178 in human DOID10192DOID3315MESHD008067 frequently create fusion transcripts encoding high mobility group (hmg) i-c dna-binding domains and c-terminal sequences from different presumed transcription factors, suggesting a potential role for hmg i-c in the development of DOID10192DOID3315MESHD008067. to evaluate the role of the hmg i-c component, the three dna-binding domains of hmg i-c have now been expressed in transgenic mice. despite the ubiquitous expression of the truncated hmg i-c protein, the transgenic mice develop a selective abundance of fat tissue early in life, show marked adipose tissue MESHD007249, and have an abnormally high incidence of DOID10192DOID3315MESHD008067. these findings demonstrate that the dna-binding domains of hmg i-c, in the absence of a c-terminal fusion partner, are sufficient to perturb adipogenesis and predispose to DOID10192DOID3315MESHD008067. we provide data supporting the central utility of this animal model as a tool to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of one of the most common kind of human benign DOID162MESHD009369.. 
10051005	a common msh2 mutation in english and north american hnpcc families: origin, phenotypic expression, and sex specific differences in OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179. the frequency, origin, and phenotypic expression of a germline msh2 gene mutation previously identified in seven kindreds with hereditary non-polyposis DOID162MESHD009369 DOID225MESHD013577 (hnpcc) was investigated. the mutation (a-- > t at nt943 + 3) disrupts the 3 splice site of exon 5 leading to the deletion of this exon from msh2 mrna and represents the only frequent msh2 mutation so far reported. although this mutation was initially detected in four of 33 OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 families analysed from eastern england, more extensive analysis has reduced the frequency to four of 52 (8%) english hnpcc kindreds analysed. in contrast, the msh2 mutation was identified in 10 of 20 (50%) separately identified colorectal families from newfoundland. to investigate the origin of this mutation in OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 families from england (n = 4), newfoundland (n = 10), and the united states (n = 3), haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers linked to msh2 was performed. within the english and us families there was little evidence for a recent common origin of the msh2 splice site mutation in most families. in contrast, a common haplotype was identified at the two flanking markers (ca5 and d2s288) in eight of the newfoundland families. these findings suggested a founder effect within newfoundland similar to that reported by others for two mlh1 mutations in finnish hnpcc families. we calculated age related risks of all, colorectal, endometrial, and DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051 in nt943 + 3 a-- > t msh2 mutation carriers (n = 76) for all patients and for men and women separately. for both sexes combined, the penetrances at age 60 years for all DOID162MESHD009369  and for OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 were 0. 86 and 0. 57, respectively. the risk of OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 was significantly higher (p < 0. 01) in males than females (0. 63 v 0. 30 and 0. 84 v 0. 44 at ages 50 and 60 years, respectively). for females there was a high risk of OMIM608089DOID1380DOID2871MESHD016889 (0. 5 at age 60 years) and premenopausal OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 (0. 2 at 50 years). these intersex differences in OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 risks have implications for screening programmes and for attempts to identify OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 susceptibility modifiers.
7814011	novel mutation at the initiation codon in the OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 gene in two japanese families. we have identified a new mutation of OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 (nd) gene in two japanese males from unrelated families; they showed typical ocular features of nd but no DOID1059MESHD008607 or MESHD034381. a mutation was found in both patients at the initiation codon of exon 2 of the nd gene (atg to gtg), with otherwise normal nucleotide sequences. their mothers had the normal and mutant types of the gene, which was expected for heterozygotes of the DOID4MESHD004194. the mutation of the initiation codon would cause the failure of nd gene expression or a OMIM188560 in translation thereby truncating the amino terminus of nd protein. in view of the rarity and marked heterogeneity of mutations in the nd gene, the present apparently unrelated japanese families who have lived in the same area for over two centuries presumably share the origin of the mutation.. 
8571953	haplotype and phenotype analysis of six recurrent brca1 mutations in 61 families: results of an international study. several brca1 mutations have now been found to occur in geographically diverse breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 families. to investigate mutation origin and mutation-specific phenotypes due to brca1, we constructed a haplotype of nine polymorphic markers within or immediately flanking the brca1 locus in a set of 61 breast/OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 families selected for having one of six recurrent brca1 mutations. tests of both mutations and family-specific differences in age at diagnosis were not significant. a comparison of the six mutations in the relative proportions of cases of breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 was suggestive of an effect (p =. 069), with 57% of women presumed affected because of the 1294 del 40 brca1 mutation having OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051, compared with 14% of affected women with the splice-site mutation in intron 5 of brca1. for the brca1 mutations studied here, the individual mutations are estimated to have arisen 9-170 generations ago. in general, a high degree of haplotype conservation across the region was observed, with haplotype differences most often due to mutations in the short-tandem-repeat markers, although some likely instances of recombination also were observed. for several of the instances, there was evidence for multiple, independent, brca1 mutational events. 
7166314	a new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variant (g6pd nagano) associated with congenital hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740. a new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) variant associated with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740 was reported. the patient, a 6-year-old japanese male, was noticed to have hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740 soon after birth, and a diagnosis of DOID2862MESHD005955 was made at the age of 2. he had episodes of hemolytic crisis several times after upper respiratory MESHD007239. g6pd activity of the patient was 5. 5% of normal. the enzymatic characteristics were examined when he was 5 years old, and his g6pd showed faster-than-normal electrophoretic mobility, low km g6p, high km nadp, low ki nadph, normal utilization of substrate analogues, heat instability, and a normal ph optimum curve. from these results, this was considered to be a new variant and was designated g6pd nagano. MESHD007239-induced MESHD006461 and chronic hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740 seem to be due to markedly impaired enzyme activity and thermal instability. 
1468459	OMIM304110DOID14737MESHC536456. we report on nine patients with OMIM304110DOID14737MESHC536456 (OMIM304110DOID14737MESHC536456). seven classical cases had facial features suggestive of OMIM136760OMIM613451OMIM613456MESHC538065 and coronal DOID2340OMIM123100OMIM190440OMIM600775OMIM614485OMIM615314OMIM615529OMIM616602OMIM617439MESHD003398. extracranial abnormalities such as brittle nails with prominent longitudinal grooves or DOID11193OMIM186000MESHD013576 of fingers and toes were observed in individual patients. in two families the father of classical cases showed a milder pattern of abnormalities, consistent with the diagnosis. we present a 2- to 13-year follow-up on our patients. MESHD009123 and laxity of joints are common and may necessitate supportive measures. mild developmental delay was noted in three out of six classical cases studied in detail. unlike almost all other x-linked disorders, clinical expression in OMIM304110DOID14737MESHC536456 is generally much more severe in females than in males. in contrast to previous reports of this condition, one of our severely affected cases is a male.. 
1707231	a new mutation in the proteolipid protein (plp) gene in a german family with pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194. a c-to-t transition in exon 4 of the plp gene was found in 2 affected males and two obligate carriers in a german family with pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194. the mutation, which causes loss of an hphi site and changes amino acid 155 from threonine to isoleucine, was absent from 108 normal chromosomes. there are 5 concordances and 1 discrepancy between these results and those obtained by magnetic resonance imaging in this family.. 
7579347	the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 and x-linked congenital DOID1588MESHD013921 are caused by mutations of the same gene. the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 (was) is an x-linked recessive disorder characterized by DOID1588MESHD013921, small platelets, DOID2723MESHD004485, recurrent MESHD007239, and immunodeficiency. besides the classic was phenotype, there is a group of patients with congenital x-linked DOID1588MESHD013921 (OMIM313900MESHC564052) who have small platelets but only transient DOID2723MESHD004485, if any, and minimal immune deficiency. because the gene responsible for was has been sequenced, it was possible to correlate the was phenotypes with was gene mutations. using a fingerprinting screening technique, we determined the approximate location of the mutation in 13 unrelated was patients with mild to severe clinical symptoms. direct sequence analysis of cdna and genomic dna obtained from patient-derived cell lines showed 12 unique mutations distributed throughout the was gene, including insertions, deletions, and point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions, termination, exon skipping, or splicing defects. of 4 unrelated patients with the OMIM313900MESHC564052 phenotype, 3 had missense mutations affecting exon 2 and 1 had a splice-site mutation affecting exon 9. patients with classic was had more complex mutations, resulting in termination codons, frameshift, and early termination. these findings provide direct evidence that OMIM313900MESHC564052 and was are caused by mutations of the same gene and suggest that severe clinical phenotypes are associated with complex mutations.. 
1709636	a 3-base pair in-frame deletion of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene results in a kinetic variant of OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661. OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 (OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661) is an autosomal recessive DOID4MESHD004194 due to deficiency of a hepatic enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600). the absence of OMIM178600 activity results in typical OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 while persistence of a residual enzyme activity gives rise to variant forms of the DOID4MESHD004194. we report here a 3-base pair in-frame deletion of the OMIM178600 gene (delta 194) in a mild variant, with markedly reduced affinity of the enzyme for phenylalanine (km = 160 nm), and we provide functional evidence for responsibility of the deletion in the mutant phenotype. since the deletion was located in the third exon of the gene, which presents no homology with other hydroxylases, we suggest that exon 3 is involved in the specificity of the enzyme for phenylalanine. finally, since none of the 98 OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 patients tested were found to carry this particular deletion, our study suggests that this molecular event probably occurred recently on the background of a haplotype 2 gene in portugal.. 
10633128	OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561: an overview. OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561, an autosomal recessive DOID1289MESHD019636, is the most common of the inherited MESHD001259. the recent discovery of the gene that is mutated in this condition, OMIM229300MESHC565561, has led to rapid advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561. about 98% of mutant alleles have an expansion of a gaa trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the gene. this leads to reduced levels of the protein, frataxin. there is mounting evidence to suggest that OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561 is the result of accumulation of iron in mitochondria leading to excess production of free radicals, which then results in cellular damage and MESHD003643. currently there is no known treatment that alters the natural course of the DOID4MESHD004194. the discovery of the OMIM229300MESHC565561 gene and its possible function has raised hope that rational therapeutic strategies will be developed.. 
10737119	clinical and molecular genetics of DOID0050835OMIM617284MESHD020821. DOID0050835OMIM617284MESHD020821 are DOID480MESHD009069 with DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421 as a major symptom. they are frequently inherited as mendelian traits. there are at least eight clinically distinct OMIM178110MESHC566739 and two x-linked recessive forms. in addition, pedigree analyses suggest the occurrence of an autosomal recessive variant. the clinical classification is increasingly being replaced by a genetic one. to date gene loci have been identified in at least six OMIM178110MESHC566739 forms, i. e., in idiopathic torsion DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421 (9q34), focal DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421 (18p), adult-onset idiopathic torsion DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421 of mixed type (8p21-q22), dopa-responsive DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421 (14q22. 1-q22. 2), and OMIM118800MESHC537181 (2q25-q33; 1p21-p13. 3). gene loci in the x-linked recessive  forms have been assigned to xq13. 1 in the x-linked DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421 OMIM600116MESHD020734 DOID225MESHD013577 and to xq22 in DOID0080783, DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421, and DOID1059MESHD008607. the DOID4MESHD004194 genes have been identified in two OMIM178110MESHC566739 forms and in one x-linked recessive form. mutations in a gene coding for an atp-binding protein were detected in idiopathic torsion DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421 (OMIM128100MESHC538005), and the gtp cyclohydrolase 1 gene is mutated in dopa-responsive DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421 (OMIM128230MESHC538007). in sensorineural MESHD003638, DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421, and DOID1059MESHD008607 , mutations were found in the gene OMIM304700DOID0050757MESHC535808 coding for a polypeptide of unknown function. this article reviews the clinical and molecular genetics of DOID0050835OMIM617284MESHD020821, critically discusses present findings, and proposes referring to the known forms, most of which can be distinguished by genetic criteria, as dystonias 1-12.
10533031	clinical and genetic study of OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561 in an australian population. OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561 is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the OMIM229300MESHC565561 gene that encodes a 210-amino acid protein called frataxin. an expansion of a gaa trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the gene is present in more than 95% of mutant alleles. of the 83 people we studied who have mutations in OMIM229300MESHC565561, 78 are homozygous for an expanded gaa repeat; the other five patients have an expansion in one allele and a point mutation in the other. here we present a detailed clinical and genetic study of a subset of 51 patients homozygous for an expansion of the gaa repeat. we found a correlation between the size of the smaller of the two expanded alleles and age at onset, age into wheelchair, DOID0060249MESHD012600, impaired vibration sense, and the presence of foot MESHD000013. there was no significant correlation between the size of the smaller allele and DOID0050700MESHD009202, DOID9351MESHD003920, loss of proprioception, or bladder symptoms. the larger allele size correlated with bladder symptoms and the presence of foot MESHD000013. the duration of DOID4MESHD004194 is correlated with wheelchair use and the presence of diabetes, DOID0060249MESHD012600, bladder symptoms and impaired proprioception, and vibration sense but no other complications studied.. 
492812	recurrent meningococcal DOID9471MESHD008581 with absence of the sixth component of complement: an evaluation of underlying immunologic mechanisms. a 51/2-year-old black girl with recurrent meningococcal DOID9471MESHD008581 and absence of the sixth component of complement (c6) is reported. to explore the pathogenesis of recurrent neisserial MESHD007239 in OMIM612446MESHC567307, a detailed analysis of her immune competence was conducted. her serum had normal chemotactic, opsonic, alternative complement pathway, and specific antibody activity, but lacked complement-mediated bacteriolytic activity. in addition, her c6-deficient serum was indistinguishable from normal serum in a complement-dependent assay of phagocyte bactericidal activity. absent bacteriolysis remains the only consistent OMIM188560 associated with recurrent neisserial MESHD007239 and absence of one of the late-acting complement components.. 
10519880	mutation of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (cyp27) results in truncation of mrna expressed in leucocytes in a japanese family with OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294. objectives  a japanese family with OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294 (OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294) was investigated for a sequence alteration in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (cyp27). the expression of cyp27 has been mostly explored using cultured fibroblasts, prompting the examination of the transcripts from blood leucocytes as a simple and rapid technique. methods  an alteration in cyp27 of the proband was searched for by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (pcr-sscp) analysis and subsequent sequencing. samples of rna were subjected to reverse transcription pcr (rt-pcr) and the product of the proband was amplified with nested primers and sequenced. results  a homozygous g to a transition at the 5 end of intron 7 was detected in the patient. in rt-pcr analysis, only a truncated transcript was detected in the patient, whereas both normal and truncated transcripts were detected in the siblings. the sequencing of the patients cdna fragment disclosed a direct conjuction of exon 6 and exon 8. conclusion  the mutation at splice donor site and the truncation of mrna were identical with those of a recently reported italian patient, although different in symptomatology. the application of blood leucocytes can be a simple technique on analysing a constructive abnormality of cyp27 mrna.. 
8187068	frequent detection of codon 877 mutation in the androgen receptor gene in advanced DOID10283OMIM176807OMIM607592MESHD011471. prostatic tissue specimens derived from transurethral resections of patients with metastatic OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 were analyzed for genetic alterations in the hormone-binding domain of the androgen receptor (ar) gene. direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-derived dnas of 6 of 24 specimens revealed a codon 877 mutation (act-- > gct, thr-- > ala) in the hormone-binding domain of the ar gene. this same ar mutation has been reported previously in a metastatic OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 cell line, lncap, where this mutation confers upon the ar an altered ligand-binding specificity which is stimulated by estrogens, progestagens, and antiandrogens. it is possible that analogous to an activated/altered growth factor receptor oncogene, codon 877 mutant ar with altered ligand binding may provide a selective growth advantage in the genesis of a subset of advanced OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471. although estrogens are used infrequently, antiandrogens are used increasingly in hormonal therapy for patients with advanced OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471. the stimulatory effect of these therapeutic agents on the codon 877 mutant ar further suggests that this frequently observed ar mutation may contribute to the treatment refractory DOID4MESHD004194.. 
10802669	atm-dependent phosphorylation of nibrin in response to radiation exposure. mutations in the gene atm are responsible for the DOID630MESHD030342 MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 (a-t), which is characterized by DOID2786MESHD002526, radiosensitivity, MESHD043171 and DOID162MESHD009369 predisposition. both the a-t phenotype and the similarity of the atm protein to other dna-damage sensors suggests a role for atm in biochemical pathways involved in the recognition, signalling and repair of dna double-strand breaks (dsbs). there are strong parallels between the pattern of radiosensitivity, MESHD043171 and DOID162MESHD009369 predisposition in a-t patients and that in patients with OMIM251260DOID7400MESHD049932 (OMIM251260OMIM601358DOID7400MESHC536116MESHD049932). the protein defective in OMIM251260OMIM601358DOID7400MESHC536116MESHD049932, nibrin (encoded by nbs1), forms a complex with mre11 and rad50 (refs 1, 2). this complex localizes to dsbs within 30 minutes after cellular exposure to ionizing radiation (ir) and is observed in brightly staining nuclear foci after a longer period of time. the overlap between clinical and cellular phenotypes in a-t and OMIM251260OMIM601358DOID7400MESHC536116MESHD049932 suggests that atm and nibrin may function in the same biochemical pathway. here we demonstrate that nibrin is phosphorylated within one hour of treatment of cells with ir. this response is abrogated in a-t cells that either do not express atm protein or express near full-length mutant protein. we also show that atm physically interacts with and phosphorylates nibrin on serine 343 both in vivo and in vitro. phosphorylation of this site appears to be functionally important because mutated nibrin (s343a) does not completely complement radiosensitivity in OMIM251260OMIM601358DOID7400MESHC536116MESHD049932 cells. atm phosphorylation of nibrin does not affect nibrin-mre11-rad50 association as revealed by radiation-induced foci formation. our data provide a biochemical explanation for the similarity in phenotype between a-t and OMIM251260OMIM601358DOID7400MESHC536116MESHD049932.. 
1346924	detection of an unstable fragment of dna specific to individuals with OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223. OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) is the most common form of adult DOID9884MESHD009136, with a prevalence of 2-14 per 100, 000 individuals. the DOID4MESHD004194 is characterized by progressive MESHD018908 and sustained muscle contraction, often with a wide range of accompanying symptoms. the age at onset and severity of the DOID4MESHD004194 show extreme variation, both within and between families. despite its clinical variability, this dominant condition segregates as a single locus at chromosome 19q13. 3 in every population studied. it is flanked by the tightly linked genetic markers ercc1 proximally and d19s51 distally; these define the dm critical region. we report the isolation of an expressed sequence from this region which detects a dna fragment that is larger in affected individuals than in normal siblings or unaffected controls. the size of this fragment varies between affected siblings, and increases in size through generations in parallel with increasing severity of the DOID4MESHD004194. we postulate that this unstable dna sequence is the molecular feature that underlies dm. 
10987655	detection of a novel missense mutation and second recurrent mutation in the cacna1a gene in individuals with ea-2 and OMIM141500MESHC536890. mutations in the brain specific p/q type ca2 + channel alpha1 subunit gene, cacna1a, have been identified in three clinically distinct disorders, viz. DOID963MESHC580065 type 2 (ea-2), familial hemiplegic OMIM157300DOID6364MESHD008881 (OMIM141500MESHC536890) and OMIM183086DOID0050957DOID1441OMIM164400OMIM164500OMIM183090OMIM600223OMIM600224OMIM612876OMIM613728OMIM613908OMIM613909OMIM614153OMIM614229OMIM614322OMIM614831OMIM615386OMIM615705OMIM615768OMIM615957OMIM616053OMIM616127OMIM616204OMIM616354OMIM616410OMIM616719OMIM616795OMIM616948OMIM616949OMIM617018OMIM617133MESHD020754 (OMIM183086DOID0050957DOID1441OMIM164400OMIM164500OMIM183090OMIM600223OMIM600224OMIM612876OMIM613728OMIM613908OMIM613909OMIM614153OMIM614229OMIM614322OMIM614831OMIM615386OMIM615705OMIM615768OMIM615957OMIM616053OMIM616127OMIM616204OMIM616354OMIM616410OMIM616719OMIM616795OMIM616948OMIM616949OMIM617018OMIM617133MESHD020754). for individuals with ea-2, the mutations described thus far are presumed to result in a truncated protein product. several different missense mutations have been identified in patients with OMIM141500MESHC536890. at least two of these mutations have been identified on two different chromosome 19p13 haplotypes and thus represent recurrent mutations. in the present study, we have screened several individuals for mutations in all 47 exons in the cacna1a gene by single-strand conformation analysis. we have characterised a novel missense mutation, g5260a, in exon 32 in a family segregating for ea-2. the consequence of this mutation is an amino acid substitution at a highly conserved position within the cacna1a gene. this represents the first point mutation not resulting in a proposed truncated protein. furthermore, this mutation has been detected in a family member with mild clinical signs including only OMIM157300DOID6364MESHD008881. additionally, a second previously identified recurrent muta tion, c2272t, in exon 16 has been discovered in a patient with OMIM141500MESHC536890.. 
10213492	dominant negative effect of the apc1309 mutation: a possible explanation for genotype-phenotype correlations in DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125. inactivation of the DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125) gene product initiates colorectal MESHD063646. patients with familial OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM105210) carry germ-line mutations in the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene and develop multiple colorectal DOID657DOID3172DOID5403DOID6204MESHD000236 and subsequent DOID305DOID4015MESHD002277 early in life. the severity of the DOID4MESHD004194 correlates with the position of the inherited OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutation (genotype-phenotype correlation). together with the fact that both germ-line and sporadic OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutations cluster in the central region of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene, this points to a dominant negative effect of certain OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 mutants. loss of OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 function was recently shown to result in enhanced beta-catenin-/tcf-mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells. here, we provide experimental evidence for a dominant negative effect of OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene products associated with severe polyposis. wild-type OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 activity in beta-catenin-/tcf-mediated transcription was strongly inhibited by a mutant OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 that is truncated at codon 1309. in contrast, mutant OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene products that are associated with attenuated polyposis (codon 386 or 1465) interfered only weakly with wild-type OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 activity. these results suggest a molecular explanation for the genotype-phenotype correlation in OMIM105210 patients and support the idea that DOID9256OMIM114500OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 growth might be, in part, driven by selection for a mutation in the mutation cluster region.. 
1717985	mutation of the kit (mast/stem cell growth factor receptor) protooncogene in human OMIM172800DOID3263MESHD016116. OMIM172800DOID3263MESHD016116 is an OMIM178110MESHC566739 DOID630MESHD030342 characterized by cogenital patches of skin and hair from which melanocytes are completely absent. a similar disorder of mouse, dominant white MESHD008796 (w), results from mutations of the c-kit protooncogene, which encodes and receptor for mast/stem cell growth factor. we identified a kit gene mutation in a proband with classic OMIM178110MESHC566739 OMIM172800DOID3263MESHD016116. this mutation results in a gly----arg substitution at codon 664, within the tyrosine kinase domain. this substitution was not seen in any normal individuals and was completely linked to the piebald phenotype in the probands family. OMIM172800DOID3263MESHD016116 in this family thus appears to be the human homologue to dominant white MESHD008796 (w) of the mouse.. 
8104633	an arylsulfatase a (arsa) missense mutation (t274m) causing late-infantile OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966. OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 (OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of arylsulfatase a (arsa; ec 3. 1. 6. 8). the 8 arsa exons and adjacent intron boundaries from a patient with late-infantile OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 were polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplified in seven discrete reactions. amplified arsa exons were analysed for the presence of sequence alterations by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, followed by direct sequencing of pcr products. the patient was found to be homozygous for a c-- > t transition in exon iv that results in the substitution of a highly conserved threonine residue at amino acid 274 with a methionine (t274m). analysis of a further 29 OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 patients revealed the presence of five additional homozygotes for t274m. all 6 t274m homozygotes (representing four families) were of lebanese descent, and all were known to be the result of consanguineous marriages. the altered amino acid is rigidly conserved among 10 sulfatases from escherichia coli to humans; therefore, it is most likely that the resultant mutant protein will have little or no enzyme activity. this is consistent with the very low arsa activity measured in these patients and their uniformly severe clinical presentation 
7717396	mutations in the gene for DOID10588OMIM300100MESHD000326 in patients with different clinical phenotypes. recently, the gene for the most common DOID906MESHD018901, DOID10588OMIM300100MESHD000326 (OMIM300100MESHD000326), has been described encoding a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein. we analyzed the entire protein-coding sequence of this gene by reverse-transcription pcr, sscp, and dna sequencing in five patients with different clinical expression of OMIM300100MESHD000326 and in their female relatives; these clinical expressions were cerebral childhood OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326, OMIM300100MESHD000326 (amn), and " OMIM240200DOID13774MESHD000224 only " (ado) phenotype. in the three patients exhibiting the classical picture of severe childhood OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 we identified in the 5 portion of the OMIM300100MESHD000326 gene a 38-bp deletion that causes a frameshift mutation, a 3-bp deletion leading to a deletion of an amino acid in the atp-binding domain of the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 protein, and a missense mutation. in the patient with the clinical phenotype of amn, a nonsense mutation in codon 212, along with a second site mutation at codon 178, was observed. analysis of the patient with the ado phenotype revealed a further missense mutation at a highly conserved position in the aldp/pmp70 comparison. the disruptive nature of two mutations (i. e., the frameshift and the nonsense mutation) in patients with biochemically proved childhood OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 and amn further strongly supports the hypothesis that alterations in this gene play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of OMIM300100MESHD000326. since the current biochemical techniques for OMIM300100MESHD000326 carrier detection in affected families lack sufficient reliability, our procedure described for systematic mutation scanning is also capable of improving genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis 
8571951	DOID0050648 type ii is caused by mutations in the OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170 sulfate-transporter gene (dtdst): evidence for a phenotypic series involving three chondrodysplasias. DOID0050648 type ii (ao ii) is a neonatally lethal chondrodysplasia whose clinical and histological characteristics resemble those of another chondrodysplasia, the much less severe OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170 (OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170). the similarity suggests a shared pathogenesis involving lesions in the same biochemical pathway and perhaps the same gene. OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170 is caused by mutations in the recently identified OMIM222600DOID14687MESHC536170 sulfate-transporter gene (dtdst). here, we report that OMIM256050MESHC535395 patients also have dtdst mutations, which lead to defective uptake of inorganic sulfate and insufficient sulfation of macromolecules by patient mesenchymal cells in vitro. together with our recent observation that a third even more severe chondrodysplasia, DOID0080043MESHC579878 type ib, is also caused by mutations in dtdst, these results demonstrate a phenotypic series of three chondrodysplasias of increasing severity caused by lesions in a single sulfate-transporter gene. the severity of the phenotype appears to be correlated with the predicted effect of the mutations on the residual activity of the dtdst protein.. 
10732816	emerin, deficiency of which causes emery-dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136, is localized at the inner nuclear membrane. x-linked recessive emery-dreifuss DOID9884MESHD009136 (DOID11726) is an inherited DOID423MESHD009135 characterized by the clinical triad of progressive wasting of humero-peroneal muscles, early MESHD003286 of the elbows, achilles tendons and postcervical muscles, and cardiac conduction block with a high risk of sudden MESHD003643. the gene for DOID11726 on xq28 encodes a novel protein named emerin that localizes at the nuclear membrane of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles and some other non-muscle tissues. to investigate a possible physiological role for emerin, we examined the ultrastructural localization of the protein in human skeletal muscle and hela cells, using ultrathin cryosections. we found that the immune-labeled colloidal gold particles were localized on the nucleoplasmic surface of the inner nuclear membrane, but not on the nuclear pore. emerin stayed on the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear lamina, even after detergent treatment that solubilizes membrane lipids and washes out membrane proteins. these results suggest that emerin anchors at the inner nuclear membrane through the hydrophobic stretch, and protrudes from the hydrophilic region to the nucleoplasm where it interacts with the nuclear lamina. we speculate that emerin contributes to maintain the nuclear structure and stability, as well as nuclear functions, particularly in muscle tissues that have severe stress with rigorous contraction-relaxation movements and calcium flux.. 
10447258	identification of a common pex1 mutation in DOID905OMIM214100MESHD015211. the DOID905OMIM214100MESHD015211 of DOID4MESHD004194, encompassing DOID905OMIM214100MESHD015211 and the progressively milder phenotypes of neonatal OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 and infantile DOID10582OMIM266500MESHD012035, is due to a failure to form functional peroxisomes. cell fusion complementation studies demonstrated that these DOID4MESHD004194MESHC are genetically heterogeneous, with two-thirds of all patients lying within a single complementation group, cg1. molecular genetic and cell biology studies have shown that pex1 is deficient in many cg1 patients. however, previous studies have focused on mildly affected patients and there is still no report of two mutant pex1 alleles in any DOID905OMIM214100MESHD015211 patient. furthermore, mutations in the pmp70 gene have also been identified in two DOID905OMIM214100MESHD015211 patients from cg1, raising the possibility that cg1 patients may represent a mixture of pex1-deficient and pmp70-deficient individuals. to address the molecular basis of DOID4MESHD004194 in DOID905OMIM214100MESHD015211 patients from cg1, we examined all 24 pex1 exons in four patients, including both patients that have mutations in pmp70. pex1 mutations were detected in all four patients, including a 1-bp insertion (c. 2097inst) in exon 13 that was present in three of the four patients. subsequent studies demonstrated that this mutation is present in one-half of all cg1 patients and correlates with the DOID905OMIM214100MESHD015211 phenotype. as this mutation leads to a loss of protein function its frequency makes it the most common cause of DOID905OMIM214100MESHD015211, helping to explain the high percentage of patients that belong to cg1. 
10861282	polymorphisms of the cyp2d6 gene increase susceptibility to ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166. ankylosing DOID6590MESHD013166 (as) is a common and highly familial rheumatic disorder. the sibling MESHD012008 risk ratio for the DOID4MESHD004194 is 63 and heritability assessed in twins > 90%. although mhc genes, including hla-b27, contribute only 20-50% of the genetic risk for the DOID4MESHD004194, no non-mhc gene has yet been convincingly demonstrated to influence either susceptibility to the DOID4MESHD004194 or its phenotypic expression. previous linkage and association studies have suggested the presence of a susceptibility gene for as close to, or within, the cytochrome p450 2d6 gene (cyp2d6, debrisoquine hydroxylase) located at chromosome 22q13.1. we performed a linkage study of chromosome 22 in 200 families with as affected sibling-pairs. association of alleles of the cyp2d6 gene was examined by both case-control and within-family means. for case-control studies, 617 unrelated individuals with as (361 probands from sibling-pair and parent-case trio families and 256 unrelated non-familial sporadic cases) and 402 healthy ethnically matched controls were employed. for within-family association studies, 361 families including 161 parent-case trios and 200 affected sibling-pair families were employed. homozygosity for poor metabolizer alleles was found to be associated with as. heterozygosity for the most frequent poor metabolizer allele (cyp2d6*4) was not associated with increased susceptibility to as. significant within-family association of cyp2d6*4 alleles and as was demonstrated. weak linkage was also demonstrated between cyp2d6 and as. we postulate that altered metabolism of a natural toxin or antigen by the cyp2d6 gene may increase susceptibility to as. 
10746568	molecular analysis of the genotype-phenotype relationship in OMIM227600DOID2222MESHD005171. OMIM227600DOID2222MESHD005171 is a rare haemorrhagic condition, normally inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, in which a variable clinical presentation correlates poorly with laboratory phenotype. the factor x (f10) genes of 14 unrelated individuals with OMIM227600DOID2222MESHD005171 (12 familial and two sporadic cases) were sequenced yielding a total of 13 novel mutations. family studies were performed in order to distinguish the contributions of individual mutant f10 alleles to the clinical and laboratory phenotypes. missense mutations were studied by means of molecular modelling, whereas single basepair substitutions in splice sites and the 5 flanking region were examined by in vitro splicing assay and luciferase reporter gene assay respectively. the deletion allele of a novel hexanucleotide insertion/deletion polymorphism in the f10 gene promoter region was shown by reporter gene assay, to reduce promoter activity by approximately 20%. one family manifesting an OMIM178110MESHC566739 pattern of inheritance possessed three clinically affected members who were heterozygous for a splice-site mutation that was predicted to lead to the production of a truncated protein product. a model which accounts for the dominant negative effect of this lesion is presented. variation in the antigen level of heterozygous relatives of probands was found to be significantly higher between families than within families, consistent with the view that the nature of the f10 lesion (s) segregating in a given family is a prime determinant of the laboratory phenotype. by contrast, no such relationship could be discerned between laboratory phenotype and polymorphism genotype.. 
10888879	restoration of photoreceptor ultrastructure and function in DOID8466MESHD012162 slow mice by gene therapy. the gene prph2 encodes a photoreceptor-specific membrane glycoprotein, peripherin-2 (also known as peripherin/rds), which is inserted into the rims of photoreceptor outer segment discs in a complex with rom-1 (ref. 2). the complex is necessary for the stabilization of the discs, which are renewed constantly throughout life, and which contain the visual pigments necessary for photon capture. mutations in prph2 have been shown to result in a variety of photoreceptor dystrophies, including OMIM178110MESHC566739 DOID3612DOID10176MESHD012173 pigmentosa and DOID10871DOID4448MESHD008268. a common feature of these DOID4MESHD004194MESHC is the loss of photoreceptor function, also seen in the DOID8466MESHD012162 slow (rds or prph2 rd2/rd2) mouse, which is homozygous for a null mutation in prph2. it is characterized by a complete failure to develop photoreceptor discs and outer segments, downregulation of rhodopsin and apoptotic loss of photoreceptor cells. the electroretinograms (ergs) of prph2rd2/rd2 mice have greatly diminished a-wave and b-wave amplitudes, which decline to virtually undetectable concentrations by two months. subretinal injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus (aav) encoding a prph2 transgene results in stable generation of outer segment structures and formation of new stacks of discs containing both perpherin-2 and rhodopsin, which in many cases are morphologically similar to normal outer segments. moreover, the re-establishment of the structural integrity of the photoreceptor layer also results in electrophysiological correction. these studies demonstrate for the first time that a complex ultrastructural cell OMIM188560 can be corrected both morphologically and functionally by in vivo gene transfer.. 
2563633	phenylalanine hydroxylase gene haplotypes in polynesians: evolutionary origins and absence of alleles associated with severe OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661. a total of 630 haplotypes for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600) gene locus were established in five groups of polynesians comprising samoans, tongans, cook islanders, maori, and niueans. considerable genetic continuity was demonstrated between these widely dispersed populations, since three common haplotypes (4, 1, and 7) constituted over 95% of alleles. a control group of individuals from southeast asia shared the same major haplotypes, 4, 1, and 7, with polynesians. these data provide further support for the theories of genetic homogeneity and of asian affinities of the polynesian precursor populations. the absence of severe OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 (OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661) in both polynesians and southeast asians is consistent with the lack of OMIM178600 haplotypes 2 and 3, on which the severe OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 mutants have arisen among caucasians.. 
10557309	cdna microarrays detect activation of a myogenic transcription program by the pax3-fkhr fusion oncogene. alveolar DOID3247MESHD012208 is an aggressive pediatric DOID162MESHD009369 of striated muscle characterized in 60% of cases by a t (2; 13) (q35; q14). this results in the fusion of pax3, a developmental transcription factor required for limb myogenesis, with fkhr, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. the resultant pax3-fkhr gene possesses transforming properties; however, the effects of this chimeric oncogene on gene expression are largely unknown. to investigate the actions of these transcription factors, both pax3 and pax3-fkhr were introduced into nih 3t3 cells, and the resultant gene expression changes were analyzed with a murine cdna microarray containing 2, 225 elements. we found that pax3-fkhr but not pax3 activated a myogenic transcription program including the induction of transcription factors myod, myogenin, six1, and slug as well as a battery of genes involved in several aspects of muscle function. notable among this group were the growth factor gene igf2 and its binding protein igfbp5. relevance of this model was suggested by verification that three of these genes (igfbp5, hsix1, and slug) were also expressed in alveolar DOID3247MESHD012208 cell lines. this study utilizes cdna microarrays to elucidate the pattern of gene expression induced by an oncogenic transcription factor and demonstrates the profound myogenic properties of pax3-fkhr in nih 3t3 cells.. 
3032521	re-evaluation of the sublocalization of esterase d and its relation to the OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 locus by in situ hybridization. in situ hybridization of a cdna probe for the esterase d gene (esd) was carried out on human chromosomes. the probe hybridized most strongly to 13q14. 2 and 13q14. 3. this observation raises doubts concerning the most recently published assignment of esd to 13q14. 1. a deletion in an individual with OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 was reported to separate the closely linked esd and OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 (OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175) loci, placing esd proximal to OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175. quantitative in situ hybridization studies of this deletion do not confirm this interpretation. rather, they suggest that esd is missing from the deleted chromosome 13 and duplicated on the normal homolog. from these findings, we conclude that the deletion in this individual cannot be used to determine the orientation nor the sublocalization of esd and OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 within the 13q14 region. 
10612394	the dna double-strand break repair gene hmre11 is mutated in individuals with an MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684-like disorder. we show that hypomorphic mutations in hmre11, but not in atm, are present in certain individuals with an MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684-like disorder (OMIM604391OMIM615919MESHC565779). the cellular features resulting from these hmre11 mutations are similar to those seen in a-t as well as OMIM251260OMIM601358DOID7400MESHC536116MESHD049932 and include DOID1205MESHD006967 to ionizing radiation, radioresistant dna synthesis, and abrogation of atm-dependent events, such as the activation of jun kinase following exposure to gamma irradiation. although the mutant hmre11 proteins retain some ability to interact with hrad50 and nbs1, formation of ionizing radiation-induced hmre11 and nbs1 foci was absent in hmre11 mutant cells. these data demonstrate that atm and the hmre11/hrad50/nbs1 protein complex act in the same dna damage response pathway and link hmre11 to the complex pathology of a-t.. 
2450401	duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 gene expression in normal and diseased human muscle. a probe for the 5 end of the duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) gene was used to study expression of the gene in normal human muscle, myogenic cell cultures, and muscle from patients with OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388. expression was found in rna from normal fetal muscle, adult cardiac and skeletal muscle, and cultured muscle after myoblast fusion. in OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 muscle, expression of this portion of the gene was also revealed by in situ rna hybridization, particularly in regenerating muscle fibers.. 
6086495	localisation of the becker DOID9884MESHD009136 gene on the short arm of the x chromosome by linkage to cloned dna sequences. a linkage study in 30 becker DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826) kindreds using three cloned dna sequences from the x chromosome which demonstrate restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflps), suggests that the OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826 gene is located on the short arm of the x chromosome, in the p21 region. the genes for becker and duchenne dystrophies must therefore be closely linked, if not allelic, and any future dna probes found to be of practical use in one disorder should be equally applicable to the other. the linkage analysis also provides data on the frequency of recombination along the short arm of the x chromosome, and across the centromeric region.. 
10830915	age of the intronic gaa triplet repeat expansion mutation in OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561. OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561 (OMIM229300MESHC565561), the most frequently inherited MESHD001259, is due in the vast majority of cases to a large expansion of an intronic gaa repeat. using linkage disequilibrium analysis based on haplotype data of seven polymorphic markers close to the frataxin gene, the age of OMIM229300MESHC565561 founding mutational event (s) is estimated to be at least 682 +/-203 generations (95% confidence interval  564-801 g), a dating which is consistent with little or no negative selection and provides further evidence for an ancient spread of a pre-mutation (at-risk alleles) in western europe.. 
10556298	the human magel2 gene and its mouse homologue are paternally expressed and mapped to the prader-willi region. OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218) is a complex neurogenetic disorder. the phenotype is likely to be a contiguous gene DOID225MESHD013577 involving genes which are paternally expressed only, located in the human 15q11-q13 region. four mouse models of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 have been reported but these do not definitively allow the delineation of the critical region and the associated genes involved in the aetiology of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. moreover, targeted mutagenesis of mouse homologues of the human candidate OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 genes does not appear to result in any of the features of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. therefore, the isolation of new genes in this region remains crucial for a better understanding of the molecular basis of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. in this manuscript, we report the characterization of magel2 and its mouse homologue magel2. these are located in the human 15q11-q13 and mouse 7c regions, in close proximity to ndn/ndn. by northern blot analysis we did not detect any expression of magel2/magel2 but by rt-pcr analysis, specific expression was detected in fetal and adult brain and in placenta. both genes are intronless with tandem direct repeat sequences contained within a cpg island in the 5-untranscribed region. the transcripts encode putative proteins that are homologous to the mage proteins and ndn. moreover, magel2/magel2 are expressed only from the paternal allele in brain, suggesting a potential role in the aetiology of OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 and its mouse model, respectively.. 
1361100	multiple origins for OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 in europe. OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 (OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661), a disorder of amino acid metabolism prevalent among caucasians and other ethnic groups, is caused primarily by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600). OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with more than 60 molecular lesions identified in the OMIM178600 gene. the haplotype associations, relative frequencies, and distributions of five prevalent OMIM178600 mutations (r158q, r261q, ivs10nt546, r408w, and ivs12n1) were established in a comprehensive european sample population and subsequently were examined to determine the potential roles of several genetic mechanisms in explaining the present distribution of the major OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 alleles. each of these five mutations was strongly associated with only one of the more than 70 chromosomal haplotypes defined by eight rflps in or near the OMIM178600 gene. these findings suggest that each of these mutations arose through a single founding event that occurred within time periods ranging from several hundred to several thousand years ago. from the significant differences observed in the relative frequencies and distributions of these five alleles throughout europe, four of these putative founding events could be localized to specific ethnic subgroups. together, these data suggest that there were multiple, geographically and ethnically distinct origins for OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 within the european population.. 
10724160	autoinhibition and activation mechanisms of the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 protein. the rho-family gtpase, cdc42, can regulate the actin cytoskeleton through activation of OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 protein (wasp) family members. activation relieves an autoinhibitory contact between the gtpase-binding domain and the carboxy-terminal region of wasp proteins. here we report the autoinhibited structure of the gtpase-binding domain of wasp, which can be induced by the c-terminal region or by organic co-solvents. in the autoinhibited complex, intramolecular interactions with the gtpase-binding domain occlude residues of the c terminus that regulate the arp2/3 actin-nucleating complex. binding of cdc42 to the gtpase-binding domain causes a dramatic conformational change, resulting in disruption of the hydrophobic core and release of the c terminus, enabling its interaction with the actin regulatory machinery. these data show that intrinsically unstructured peptides such as the gtpase-binding domain of wasp can be induced into distinct structural and functional states depending on context.. 
1733838	localisation of the gene for OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 to between dxs7 and dxs426 on xp. a highly informative microsatellite marker, dxs426, which maps proximal to dxs7 in the interval xp11. 4-xp11 4-xp11. 23, has been used to refine further the localisation of the gene for OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 (ndp). the results from a multiply informative crossover localize the ndp gene proximal to dxs7. in conjunction with information from 2 ndp patients who have a deletion for dxs7 but not for dsx426, our data indicate that the ndp gene lies between dxs7 and dxs426 on proximal xp.
7479827	molecular basis of human mitochondrial very-MESHC535690 causing DOID0050700MESHD009202 and sudden MESHD003643 in childhood. beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids provides the major source of energy in the heart. defects in enzymes of the beta-oxidation pathway cause sudden, unexplained MESHD003643 in childhood, acute hepatic DOID936MESHD001927 or MESHD017093, skeletal DOID423MESHD009135, and DOID0050700MESHD009202. very-long-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase [vlcad; very-long-chain-acyl-coa  (acceptor) 2, 3-oxidoreductase, ec 1. 3 3. 99 99. 13] catalyzes the first step in beta-oxidation. we have isolated the human vlcad cdna and gene and determined the complete nucleotide sequences. polymerase chain reaction amplification of vlcad mrna and genomic exons defined the molecular defects in two patients with OMIM201475MESHC536353 who presented with unexplained DOID0060319MESHD006323 and DOID0050700MESHD009202. in one, a homozygous mutation in the consensus dinucleotide of the donor splice site (g + 1-- > a) was associated with universal skipping of the prior exon (exon 11). the second patient was a compound heterozygote, with a missense mutation, c1837-- > t, changing the arginine at residue 613 to tryptophan on one allele and a single base deletion at the intron-exon 6 boundary as the second mutation. this initial delineation of human mutations in vlcad suggests that OMIM201475MESHC536353 reduces myocardial fatty acid beta-oxidation and energy production and is associated with DOID0050700MESHD009202 and sudden MESHD003643 in childhood. 
1577476	an error in dystrophin mrna processing in golden retriever DOID9884MESHD009136, an animal homologue of duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136. golden retriever DOID9884MESHD009136 (grmd) is a spontaneous, x-linked, progressively fatal DOID4MESHD004194 of dogs and is also a homologue of duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388). two-thirds of OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 patients carry detectable deletions in their dystrophin gene. the OMIM188560 underlying the remaining one-third of OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 patients is undetermined. analysis of the canine dystrophin gene in normal and grmd dogs has failed to demonstrate any detectable loss of exons. here, we have demonstrated a rna processing error in grmd that results from a single base change in the 3 consensus splice site of intron 6. the seventh exon is then skipped, which predicts a termination of the dystrophin reading frame within its n-terminal domain in exon 8. this is the first example of dystrophin deficiency caused by a splice-site mutation.. 
1981994	serum amyloid a and p protein genes in familial mediterranean MESHD005334. two recent studies have suggested the involvement of serum amyloid a (saa) and p (apcs) genes in familial mediterranean MESHD005334 (mef). to test the role of saa and apcs in mef and mef-DOID9120MESHD000686, we studied 17 informative families (15 armenians, 2 non-ashkenazi jews) and 8 mef patients with DOID9120MESHD000686 using a candidate gene approach. no evidence for any mef-associated polymorphism was found in any of the 41 armenian and jewish mef patients tested. our family studies allowed us to rule out tight linkage between saa and mef (lod score = -2. 16, theta less than or equal to 0. 06). for apcs we found that the allele frequency in the mef-DOID9120MESHD000686 patients was similar to that in 18 unrelated mef patients without DOID9120MESHD000686 and their 33 healthy parents. 
1201235	glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants from italian subjects associated with severe DOID2383MESHD007567. screening for the DOID2862MESHD005955 was carried out at the maternity division of the galliera hospital in genoa, italy. two groups of subjects with DOID2741 of non-immunological origin were examined  (a) 302 newborn babies of sardinian extraction (on OMIM120970DOID0111005 blood) and (b) 201 newborn babies of south italian ancestry (on peripheral blood). among 503 subjects, 43 showed an enzyme deficiency; in 39 the OMIM188560 was of the mediterranean type. in one case, previously described, the enzyme was of the a- type. in the remaining cases three different variants were identified. in the present work these three cases, each with severe DOID2383MESHD007567, are reported. their parents originated from calabria, from sardinia and from sicily. the abnormal enzymes are respectively designated as gddcbrousse-like, gdgallura and gdagrigento.. 
1351034	loss of normal allele of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene in an DOID3948MESHD018268 from a patient with DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125. endocrine DOID162MESHD009369 have been reported occasionally in patients with DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM105210). an adrenocorotical DOID305DOID4015MESHD002277 was studied in a patient with a family history of OMIM105210. loss of heterozygosity (loh) in the region close to the DOID0050424OMIM175100OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 (OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125) gene was detected in this DOID305DOID4015MESHD002277, and evidence was obtained that there was a loss of the normal allele of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene. this is the first demonstration of loh at the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 locus in adrenocortical DOID162MESHD009369. the present results and our previous data on loh in a recurring MESHD018222 DOID162MESHD009369 suggest that the heterozygous mutant/wild-type condition of the OMIM175100DOID0050424OMIM616415OMIM617100MESHD011125 gene may give rise to benign DOID162MESHD009369, and that functional loss of this gene leads to development of DOID162MESHD009369 not only in the colon but also in other various parts of the body in OMIM105210 patients.. 
7191069	heterozygous c2-deficiency and OMIM254200DOID437MESHD009157. DOID626MESHD000081208 states in OMIM254200DOID437MESHD009157 (mg) have not been reported previously. we describe a 19-year-old woman with typical mg and heterozygous OMIM217000DOID0060295, along with hla typing of the patient and her immediate family.. 
10472529	large heterozygous deletion masquerading as homozygous missense mutation: a pitfall in diagnostic mutation analysis. the clinical use of molecular analyses in recessive disorders relies on the exact characterization of both mutant alleles in the affected patient. this can be problematic when only part of the gene is examined or when relevant dna alterations are not recognized by standard methods. we present a child in whom OMIM261600DOID9281MESHD010661 was apparently caused by homozygosity for the mutation e390g in exon 11 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (OMIM178600) gene. however, the clinical severity of the DOID4MESHD004194 was not quite as mild as expected, the mutation was not identified in the father despite confirmed paternity, and the paternal allele showed a highly unusual pattern of polymorphic markers in the OMIM178600 gene. presence of a large deletion involving exons 9, 10 and 11 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene was confirmed by long-range pcr. diagnostic dna analyses should include a comprehensive examination of the whole relevant gene in the patient and confirmation of carrier status in both parents.. 
2912069	two point mutations are responsible for g6pd polymorphism in sardinia. the human x-linked gene encoding glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) is highly polymorphic; more than 300 g6pd variants have been identified. DOID2862MESHD005955 in different geographical areas appears to have arisen through independent mutational events, but within the same population it may also be heterogeneous. one example is the island of sardinia, where careful clinical and biochemical studies have identified four different g6pd variants. we cloned and sequenced the four g6pd variants from sardinia and found that only two mutations are responsible for DOID2862MESHD005955 in this area  one mutation is the cause of the g6pd seattle-like phenotype, a milder form of DOID2862MESHD005955; the other mutation is responsible for all forms of very severe DOID2862MESHD005955 in sardinia and, possibly, in the mediterranean.. 
6902670	familial discoid DOID8857 associated with heterozygote OMIM217000DOID0060295. two siblings with chronic discoid DOID8857 and several family members were found with heterozygous OMIM217000DOID0060295. an association with histocompatibility markers hla-b18 and hla-dw2 was demonstrated, and the slow allotype of factor b was present. linkage studies in this family suggested a close linkage between the OMIM217000DOID0060295 gene and genes coding for b18, dw2, and bfs antigens. one hla-acb/dbf recombinant was observed showing closer linkage between hla-d and bf than between hla-b and bf.. 
7545954	a strong candidate for the breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 susceptibility gene brca1. a strong candidate for the 17q-linked brca1 gene, which influences susceptibility to breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051, has been identified by positional cloning methods. probable predisposing mutations have been detected in five of eight kindreds presumed to segregate brca1 susceptibility alleles. the mutations include an 11-base pair deletion, a 1-base pair insertion, a stop codon, a missense substitution, and an inferred regulatory mutation. the brca1 gene is expressed in numerous tissues, including breast and ovary, and encodes a predicted protein of 1863 amino acids. this protein contains a zinc finger domain in its amino-terminal region, but is otherwise unrelated to previously described proteins. identification of brca1 should facilitate early diagnosis of breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 susceptibility in some individuals as well as a better understanding of OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 biology.. 
8198128	recombinations in individuals homozygous by descent localize the OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561 locus in a cloned 450-kb interval. the locus for OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561 (OMIM229300MESHC565561), a severe DOID1289MESHD019636, is tightly linked to markers d9s5 and d9s15, and analysis of rare recombination events has suggested the order cen-OMIM229300MESHC565561-d9s5-d9s15-qter. we report here the construction of a yac contig extending 800 kb centromeric to d9s5 and the isolation of five new microsatellite markers from this region. in order to map these markers with respect to the OMIM229300MESHC565561 locus, all within a 1-cm confidence interval, we sought to increase the genetic information of available OMIM229300MESHC565561 families by considering homozygosity by descent and association with founder haplotypes in isolated populations. this approach allowed us to identify one phase-known recombination and one probable historic recombination on haplotypes from reunion island patients, both of which place three of the five markers proximal to OMIM229300MESHC565561. this represents the first identification of close OMIM229300MESHC565561 flanking markers on the centromeric side. the two other markers allowed us to narrow the breakpoint of a previously identified distal recombination that is > 180 kb from d9s5 (26p). taken together, the results place the OMIM229300MESHC565561 locus in a 450-kb interval, which is small enough for direct search of candidate genes. a detailed rare cutter restriction map and a cosmid contig covering this interval were constructed and should facilitate the search of genes in this region.. 
2220826	further mapping of an MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 locus to the chromosome 11q23 region. we recently mapped the gene for MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 group a (ata) to chromosome 11q22-23 by linkage analysis, using the genetic markers thy1 and pynb3. 12 (d11s144). the most likely order was cent-at-s144-thy1. the present paper describes further mapping of the at locus by means of a panel of 10 markers that span approximately 60 cm in the 11q22-23 region centered around s144 and thy1. location scores indicate that three contiguous subsegments within the [s144-thy1] segment, as well as three contiguous segments telomeric to thy1, are each unlikely to contain the at locus, while the more centromeric [stmy-s144] segment is most likely to contain the at locus. these data, together with recent refinements in the linkage and physical maps of 11q22-23, place the at locus at 11q23. 
1311721	proliferation-related expression of p19/nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase. high level expression of the nm23-h1 gene, which encodes for a nucleoside diphosphate kinase, has been found to correlate with diminished MESHD009362 in some DOID162MESHD009369 but not in others. we have previously identified the protein product of the nm23-h1 gene in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels and have designated it p19/nm23. in DOID769OMIM256700OMIM613013OMIM613014OMIM613015OMIM613016OMIM613017MESHD009447, higher levels of p19/nm23, which are associated with amplification of the n-myc oncogene, large DOID162MESHD009369 mass, and MESHD009362, were observed in advanced stage DOID162MESHD009369 compared with limited stage DOID4MESHD004194. because of the variable expression of nm23-h1 in different DOID162MESHD009369, we have investigated the relationship between amounts of the protein and cell proliferation. the levels of p19/nm23 were compared between resting and mitotically stimulated normal human pbls and in DOID1240MESHD007938 cells. the amount of p19/nm23 increased in normal lymphocytes in response to mitotic stimulation and paralleled the increase in dna synthesis. in DOID1240MESHD007938 cells obtained from patients with different subtypes of DOID12603, p19/nm23 levels were also increased relative to resting normal lymphocytes. treatment of mitotically stimulated lymphocytes with cyclosporin, which inhibits proliferation, blocked the increase in p19/nm23; treatment of the DOID1240MESHD007938 cell line hl-60 with dimethylsulfoxide, which induces terminal differentiation, resulted in diminished levels of p19/nm23. our data therefore provide evidence that nm23-h1 expression is related to cell proliferative activity.. 
116187	carrier detection of OMIM266150DOID3651MESHD015324 in fibroblasts and lymphocytes. pyruvate carboxylase (e. c. 6. 4. 1. 1) activity was determined in the circulating peripheral lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from the family of a patient with hepatic, cerebral, renal cortical, leukocyte, and fibroblast OMIM266150DOID3651MESHD015324 (pc portland deficiency). lymphocyte activities were  mother, 33--39%; father, 11--29%; brother, 82--103%; and sister, 38--48% of the lowest normal. fibroblasts from the patients mother and father had 42 and 34%, respectively, of the activity of the lowest normal. these data demonstrate that the DOID4MESHD004194 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and that lymphocytes and fibroblasts can be used to detect carriers. neither pyruvate carboxylase nor mitochondrial pepck activity in lymphocytes was increased by a 21-hr fast. 
2852474	complex OMIM307030DOID0060363: molecular-genetic, cytogenetic, and clinical studies of five japanese patients. five male japanese patients with complex OMIM307030DOID0060363 (cgkd) and their relatives were studied clinically, cytogenetically, and molecular-genetically. all patients had DOID9884MESHD009136 or MESHD018908, DOID1059MESHD008607, congenital OMIM240200, and OMIM307030DOID0060363. high-resolution gtg-banded chromosomes showed a microdeletion in the xp21 region in all four patients examined and in all five mothers. southern hybridizations, after digestions by restriction endonucleases, with various cloned dnas (d2, 99-6, b24, c7, l1-4, cdmd13-14, j66-hi, p20, j-bir, ert87-30, ert87-15, ert87-8, ert87-1, xj-1. 1, 754, cx5. 7, and otc-1) that are located around xp21 also showed a deletion in the genome of all patients and mothers. although the deletion differed in size among patients, a segment commonly absent was located between the genomic sequences corresponding to l1-4 and cdmd13-14. this finding indicated that the gene coding for glycerol kinase (gk) is located within this segment. a comparison of the clinical manifestations of the present five patients and reported cgkd or duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) patients with dna deletion suggests the existence of a certain gene responsible for gonadotropin deficiency (gtd). the result of the present study and results of previous studies suggest that genes for ornithine transcarbamylase (otc), OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388, and gk and putative genes responsible for congenital OMIM240200 (OMIM300200DOID0050635MESHD000075262) and gtd are arranged from telomere to centromere as pter--gtd--OMIM300200DOID0050635MESHD000075262--gk--OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388--otc--cen 
7726234	duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 and OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 in the same patient. we report on the first patient identified with OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 and duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388). the family of the propositus had a strong history of OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223, and there was an intrafamilial pathological expansion of the responsible ctg repeat between the mildly affected mother (160 repeats; normal 27 repeats) and her more severely affected son (650 repeats), and his sister (650 repeats). the propositus was an isolated case of duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 with marked dystrophin deficiency in muscle biopsy. the patient was still ambulatory post age 16. OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 could interfere to some extent with the progression of duchenne dystrophy. however, other interpretations are possible. twelve percent of dystrophin revertant fibers as observed by immunohistochemistry could be sufficient to ameliorate typical OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 clinical severity, or the patient may present a somatic mosaic. the pathophysiological interactions of these two unlinked disorders are discussed at the clinical and histopathological levels.. 
8500791	autosomal recessive transmission of OMIM306700DOID12134MESHD006467 due to a von willebrand factor mutation. the differential diagnosis of the genetic MESHD006470 disorders, OMIM306700DOID12134MESHD006467 and DOID12531MESHD014842, is occasionally confounded by the close molecular relationship of coagulation factor viii and von willebrand factor (vwf). this report describes the autosomal inheritance of a OMIM306700DOID12134MESHD006467 phenotype due to a mutation of vwf that results in defective factor viii binding. the proband was a female patient with low levels of factor viii activity. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification and dna sequencing were employed to examine exons encoding the putative factor viii binding domain of vwf. the patient was found to be homozygous for a single point mutation causing a thr-- > met substitution at amino acid position 28 in the mature vwf subunit. the phenotypic expression of the mutation was determined to be recessive because heterozygous family members were clinically unaffected. recombinant vwf containing the observed amino acid substitution was expressed in cos-1 cells. the mutant vwf was processed and secreted normally, and was functionally equivalent to wild-type vwf in its ability to bind to platelets. however, the mutant failed to bind factor viii, demonstrating that the mutation was functionally related to the observed OMIM306700MESHD006467 phenotype. the family we describe demonstrates the recessive inheritance of a recently recognized class of genetic MESHD006470 disorders, we call " autosomal OMIM306700MESHD006467. " we conclude that vwf mutation may be an under recognized cause of OMIM306700MESHD006467, especially in cases where the inheritance pattern is not consistent with x-linked transmission. 
10737980	determination of 30 DOID10588OMIM300100MESHD000326 mutations, including 15 not previously described. DOID10588OMIM300100MESHD000326 (OMIM300100MESHD000326) is the most frequent DOID906. it mainly involves the nervous system white matter, adrenal cortex and testes. several distinct clinical phenotypes are known. the principal biochemical abnormality is the accumulation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (vlcfas  > c22  0, mainly c26  0), which is due to impaired capacity for beta-oxidation in peroxisomes. diagnosis is usually based on the vlcfa levels in plasma or cultured skin fibroblasts in both patients and carriers. in 0. 1% of affected males, however, the plasma c26  0 level is borderline normal, and 15% of obligate female carriers have normal results. effective mutation detection in these families is therefore fundamental to unambiguously determine the genetic status of each individual at risk. of particular concern are female members of kindreds segregating OMIM300100MESHD000326 mutations, because normal vlcfa levels do not guarantee lack of carrier status. we describe a fast method for detection of OMIM300100MESHD000326 mutations. the method is based on sscp analysis of nested pcr fragments followed by sequence-determination reactions. using this methodology we have found OMIM300100MESHD000326 mutations in 30 kindreds, including 15 not previously reported. 
7894491	mutations in the brca1 gene in families with early-onset breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. we analysed 50 probands with a family history of breast and/or OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 for germline mutations in the coding region of the brca1 candidate gene, using single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis on pcr-amplified genomic dna. a total of eight putative DOID4MESHD004194-causing alterations were identified  four of these are frameshifts and two are nonsense mutations. in addition, we found two missense mutations, one of which changes the final cysteine of the brca1 zinc finger motif to glycine. these data are consistent with a tumour suppressor model, and support the notion that this candidate gene is in fact brca1. the heterogeneity of mutations, coupled with the large size of the gene, indicates that clinical application of brca1 mutation testing will be technically challenging.. 
2355960	screening for carriers of OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 among ashkenazi jews. a comparison of dna-based and enzyme-based tests. background and methods. the prevention of OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 (DOID3321MESHD020143, type 1) depends on the identification of carriers of the gene for this autosomal recessive disorder. we compared the enzyme-based test widely used in screening for OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661 with a test based on analysis of dna. we developed methods to detect the three mutations in the hexa gene that occur with high frequency among ashkenazi jews  two mutations cause infantile OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661, and the third causes the adult-onset form of the DOID4MESHD004194. dna segments containing these mutation sites were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction and analyzed for the presence of the mutations. results. among 62 ashkenazi obligate carriers of OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661, the three specific mutations accounted for all but one of the mutant alleles (98 percent). in 216 ashkenazi carriers identified by the enzyme test, dna analysis showed that 177 (82 percent) had one of the identified mutations. of the 177, 79 percent had the exon 11 insertion mutation, 18 percent had the intron 12 splice-junction mutation, and 3 percent had the less severe exon 7 mutation associated with adult-onset DOID4MESHD004194. the results of the enzyme tests in the 39 subjects (18 percent) who were defined as carriers but in whom dna analysis did not identify a mutant allele were probably false positive (although there remains some possibility of unidentified mutations). in addition, of 152 persons defined as noncarriers by the enzyme-based test, 1 was identified as a carrier by dna analysis (i. e e., a false negative enzyme-test result). conclusions. the increased specificity and predictive value of the dna-based test make it a useful adjunct to the diagnostic tests currently used to screen for carriers of OMIM272800DOID3320MESHD013661. 
8002973	OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 gene encodes an 80 kda membrane protein. an antibody against the synthetic c-terminal peptides deduced from the cdna of the gene responsible for DOID10588OMIM300100MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326) was produced to characterize the product of the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 gene. the antibody reacted with the 80 kda band protein in control fibroblasts, while no bands were detected in the fibroblasts from a patient with OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (# 163), in which mrna of the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 gene was undetectable based on northern blot analysis. the 293t cells transfected with the full-coding cdna inserted in the expression vector produced a new 80 kda protein, as detected by western blot. in an immunocytological study, the staining was in a punctate pattern, in the normal fibroblasts. however, there was no punctate staining in the # 163 cells. these data thus indicate that the OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 gene encodes an 80 kda membrane protein.. 
2568588	preferential germline mutation of the paternal allele in OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175. the event triggering malignant proliferation in 70% of OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 tumours is loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 13q14, whereby the normal OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 gene (OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175) allele is lost and an already mutated OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 allele remains in the tumour. the first allele suffers a mutational event--deletion, duplication or point mutation (manuscript in preparation) --either in the germ line (all bilateral patients) or in a somatic retinal cell (most unilateral patients). most bilateral patients have no family history of OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 and are presumed to have new germline mutations which arose in the egg, sperm or early embryo. we have determined the parental origin of the retained allele in nine OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 tumours from eight unrelated non-familial cases by using OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175-linked genetic markers. six tumours retained the paternal allele and three retained the maternal allele. of the three unilateral tumours, only one retained the paternal OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 allele. thus, there is no evidence that the paternal OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 allele is preferentially retained in OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175, as has been suggested to be the case in OMIM259500DOID3347MESHD012516. by contrast, tumours from four of the five bilateral patients retained the paternal OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 allele. this suggests either that new germline OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 mutations arise more frequently during spermatogenesis than during oogenesis, or that imprinting in the early embryo affects chromosomal susceptibility to mutation.. 
10817650	mutations at the MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 locus and clinical phenotypes of a-t patients. mutations at the MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 (a-t) locus on chromosome band 11q22 cause a distinctive autosomal recessive DOID225MESHD013577 in homozygotes and predispose heterozygotes to DOID162MESHD009369, ischemic DOID114MESHD006331, and early mortality. pcr amplification from genomic dna and automated sequencing of the entire coding region (66 exons) and splice junctions detected 77 mutations (85%) in 90 a-t chromosomes. heteroduplex analysis detected another 42 mutations at the a-t locus. out of a total of 71 unique mutations, 50 were found only in a single family, and 51 had not been reported previously. most (58/71, 82%) mutations were frameshift and nonsense mutations that are predicted to cause truncation of the a-t protein; the less common mutation types were missense (9/71, 13%), splicing (3/71, 4%) and one in-frame deletion, 2546 3 (1/71, 1%). the mean survival and height distribution of 134 a-t patients correlated significantly with the specific mutations present in the patients. patients homozygous for a single truncating mutation, typically near the n-terminal end of the gene, or heterozygous for the in-frame deletion 2546 3, were shorter and had significantly shorter survival than those heterozygous for a splice site or missense mutation, or heterozygous for two truncating mutations. alterations of the length or amino acid composition of the a-t gene product affect the a-t clinical phenotype in different ways. mutation analysis at the a-t locus may help estimate the prognosis of a-t patients.. 
7815415	anticipation resulting in elimination of the OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 gene: a follow up study of one extended family. we have re-examined an extended OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) family, previously described in 1955, in order to study the long term effects of anticipation in dm and in particular the implications for families affected by this DOID4MESHD004194. this follow up study provides data on 35 gene carriers and 46 asymptomatic at risk family members in five generations. clinical anticipation, defined as the cascade of mild, adult, childhood, or congenital DOID4MESHD004194 in subsequent generations, appeared to be a relentless process, occurring in all affected branches of the family. the cascade was found to proceed asynchronously in the different branches, mainly because of an unequal number of generations with mild DOID4MESHD004194. the transition from the mild to the adult type was associated with transmission through a male parent. stable transmission of the asymptomatic/mild phenotype showed a female transmission bias. we further examined the extent and causes of gene loss in this pedigree. gene loss in the patient group was complete, owing to DOID5223MESHD007246 of the male patients with adult onset DOID4MESHD004194 and the fact that mentally retarded patients did not procreate. out of the 46 at risk subjects in the two youngest generations, only one was found to have a full mutation. this is the only subject who may transmit the gene to the sixth generation. no protomutation carriers were found in the fourth and fifth generations. therefore it is highly probable that the dm gene will be eliminated from this pedigree within one generation. the high population frequency of dm can at present not be explained by the contribution of asymptomatic cases in the younger generations of known families, but is probably caused by the events in the ancestral generations.. 
10571943	exon 9 mutations in the OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 gene, without influencing OMIM149000DOID2926MESHD007715 splice isoforms, are also responsible for frasier DOID225MESHD013577. we report new mutations in exon 9 of the OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 gene that did not alter the ratio of +/- OMIM149000DOID2926MESHD007715 splice isoforms in two unrelated patients with frasier DOID225MESHD013577 (fs). the mutation of intron 9 inducing defective alternative splicing was reported to be responsible for this DOID225MESHD013577. the mutations found in our cases occurred in the same exon of the OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 gene as detected in OMIM194080DOID3764MESHD030321 (OMIM194080OMIM304700DOID3764MESHD030321DOID0050757MESHC535808) and could not be explained by the previously proposed mechanism. the results suggest that the two DOID225MESHD013577 originate from the same OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 gene abnormality. from a molecular biological point of view, we concluded that the two DOID4MESHD004194MESHC were not separable, and that fs should be OMIM612069MESHC567429OMIM606217MESHC565249OMIM115197MESHC566169DOID0110552OMIM606346DOID0110494OMIM609006OMIM300123MESHC567485DOID0111806OMIM610125MESHC566441DOID0110927OMIM161800OMIM611590MESHC566910OMIM613750MESHC563526 as an atypical form of OMIM194080OMIM304700DOID3764MESHD030321DOID0050757MESHC535808.. 
10500204	deficit of in vivo mitochondrial atp production in patients with OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561. OMIM229300DOID12705MESHD005621MESHC565561 (OMIM229300MESHC565561), the most common of the inherited MESHD001259, is an autosomal recessive degenerative disorder, characterized clinically by onset before the age of 25 of progressive gait and MESHD001259, absence of deep tendon reflexes, extensor plantar responses, and loss of position and vibration sense in the lower limbs. OMIM229300MESHC565561 is caused by a gaa triplet expansion in the first intron of the OMIM229300MESHC565561 gene on chromosome 9q13 in 97% of patients. the OMIM229300MESHC565561 gene encodes a widely expressed 210-aa protein, frataxin, which is located in mitochondria and is severely reduced in OMIM229300MESHC565561 patients. frataxin function is still unknown but the knockout of the yeast frataxin homologue gene (yfh1) showed a severe OMIM188560 of mitochondrial respiration and loss of mtdna associated with elevated intramitochondrial iron. here we report in vivo evidence of impaired mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle of OMIM229300MESHC565561 patients. using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy we demonstrated a maximum rate of muscle mitochondrial atp production (v (max)) below the normal range in all 12 OMIM229300MESHC565561 patients and a strong negative correlation between mitochondrial v (max) and the number of gaa repeats in the smaller allele. our results show that OMIM229300MESHC565561 is a nuclear-encoded DOID700MESHD028361 affecting oxidative phosphorylation and give a rationale for treatments aimed to improve mitochondrial function in this condition.. 
2912886	chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740 (cnsha) and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency in a patient with familial amyloidotic DOID1389DOID14402MESHD011115 (OMIM105210). molecular study of a new variant (g6pd clinic) with markedly acidic ph optimum. a new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) variant with severe erythrocytic DOID2862MESHD005955 and a unique ph optimum is described in a young patient with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740 (cnsha) and familial amyloidotic DOID1389DOID14402MESHD011115 (OMIM105210). chronic MESHD006461 was present in the absence of MESHD007239, oxidant drugs or ingestion of faba beans. residual enzyme activity was about 2. 6% and 63% of normal activity in erythrocytes and leucocytes, respectively. a molecular study using standard methods showed g6pd in the patient to have normal electrophoretic mobility (at ph 7. 0, 8. 0 and 8. 8), normal apparent affinity for substrates (km, g6p and nadp) and a slightly abnormal utilization of substrate analogues (decreased deamino-nadp and increased 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate utilization). heat stability was found to be markedly decreased (8% of residual activity after 20 min of incubation at 46 degrees c) and a particular characteristic of this enzyme was a biphasic ph curve with a greatly increased activity at low ph. although molecular characteristics of this variant closely resemble those of g6pd bangkok and g6pd duarte, it can be distinguished from these and all other previously reported variants by virtue of its unusual ph curve. therefore the present variant has been designated g6pd clinic to distinguish it from other g6pd variants previously described 
3422216	regional localization of polymorphic dna loci on the proximal long arm of the x chromosome using deletions associated with OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794. in two unrelated families, males have been identified who suffer from OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794 and at the same time have an interstitial deletion on the proximal long arm of the x chromosome. by high-resolution banding we have characterized the deletion chromosomes as del (x) (q21. 1-q21 1-q21. 33) and del (x) (q21. 2-q21 2-q21. 31) respectively. by southern blot analysis we have mapped ten different polymorphic dna loci relative to the position of the deletion and the OMIM303100DOID9821MESHD015794 locus OMIM303100. one probe, p31, was shown to cover one of the breakpoints of the smallest deletion. the following order of the loci was suggested by deletion mapping  cen-dxs106-dxs72-OMIM303100- (dxys1/dxys23/dxys5) - dxys2- (dxys12/dxs3) - (dxs17/dxs101) - xqter.
2016095	a de novo unbalanced reciprocal translocation identified as paternal in origin in the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. interstitial cytogenetic deletions involving the paternally derived chromosome 15q11-13 have been described in patients with the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218). we report a child with OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 and a de novo unbalanced karyotype -45, xy, -9, -15, + der (9) t (9; 15) (q34; q13). molecular studies with the dna probe pml34 confirmed that only a single prader willi critical region (pwcr  15q11. 2-q12) copy was present. hybridisation of patient and parental dna with the multi-allelic probe cmw1, which maps to pter-15q13, showed that the chromosome involved in the translocation was paternal in origin. this is the first example of a paternally-derived pwcr allele loss caused by an unbalanced translocation that has arisen de novo. 
10807385	clinicopathologic features of brca-linked and sporadic OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051. context  most hereditary DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051 are associated with germline mutations in brca1 or brca2. attempts to define the clinical significance of brca mutation status in OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 have produced conflicting results, especially regarding survival. objective  to determine whether hereditary DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051 have distinct clinical and pathological features compared with sporadic (nonhereditary) DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051. design and setting  retrospective cohort study of a consecutive series of 933 DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051 diagnosed and treated at our institution, which is a comprehensive DOID162MESHD009369 center as designated by the national DOID162MESHD009369 institute, over a 12-year period (december 1986 to august 1998). patients  the study was restricted to patients of jewish origin because of the ease of brca1 and brca2 genotyping in this ethnic group. from the 189 patients who identified themselves as jewish, 88 hereditary cases were identified with the presence of a germline founder mutation in brca1 or brca2. the remaining 101 cases from the same series not associated with a brca mutation and 2 additional groups (gynecologic oncology group protocols 52 and 111) with OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 from clinical trials (for the survival analysis) were OMIM612069MESHC567429OMIM606217MESHC565249OMIM115197MESHC566169DOID0110552OMIM606346DOID0110494OMIM609006OMIM300123MESHC567485DOID0111806OMIM610125MESHC566441DOID0110927OMIM161800OMIM611590MESHC566910OMIM613750MESHC563526 for comparison. main outcome measures  age at diagnosis, surgical stage, histologic cell type and grade, and surgical outcome; and response to chemotherapy and survival for advanced-stage (ii and iv) cases. results  hereditary DOID162MESHD009369 were rarely diagnosed before age 40 years and were common after age 60 years, with mean age at diagnosis being significantly younger for brca1- vs brca2-linked patients (54 vs 62 years; p =. 04). histology, grade, stage, and success of cytoreductive surgery were similar for hereditary and sporadic cases. the hereditary group had a longer DOID4MESHD004194-free interval following primary chemotherapy in comparison with the nonhereditary group, with a median time to MESHD012008 of 14 months and 7 months, respectively (p <. 001). those with hereditary DOID162MESHD009369 had improved survival compared with the nonhereditary group (p =. 004). for stage iii DOID162MESHD009369, brca mutation status was an independent prognostic variable (p =. 03). conclusions  although brca-associated hereditary DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051 in this population have surgical and pathological characteristics similar to those of sporadic DOID162MESHD009369, advanced-stage hereditary DOID162MESHD009369 patients survive longer than nonhereditary DOID162MESHD009369 patients. age penetrance is greater for brca1-linked than for brca2-linked DOID162MESHD009369 in this population.
1302008	germline intronic and exonic mutations in the wilms' tumour gene (OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396) affecting urogenital development. OMIM194080DOID3764MESHD030321 is a rare human developmental disorder affecting the urogenital system and leading to DOID1074MESHD051437, intersex disorders and wilms tumour. in this report, four individuals with this DOID225MESHD013577 are described carrying germline point mutations in the wilms tumour suppressor gene, OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396. three of these mutations were in the zinc finger domains of OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396. the fourth occurred within intron 9, preventing splicing at one of the alternatively chosen splice donor sites of exon 9 when assayed in vitro. these results provide genetic evidence for distinct functional roles of the OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 isoforms in urogenital development.. 
3014348	analysis of deletions in dna from patients with becker and duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136. duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) is an x-linked recessive DOID630MESHD030342 for which the biochemical OMIM188560 is as yet unknown. recently, two cloned segments of human x-chromosome dna have been described which detect structural alterations within or near the genetic locus responsible for the disorder. both of these cloned segments were described as tightly linked to the locus and were capable of detecting deletions in the dna of boys affected with OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388. in an attempt to determine more precisely the occurrence of these deletions within a large population of OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 patients and the accuracy of one of the segments, dxs164 (pert87), in determining the inheritance of the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 x chromosome, the subclones 1, 8 and 15 were made available to many investigators throughout the world. here we describe the combined results of more than 20 research laboratories with respect to the occurrence of deletions at the dxs164 locus in dna samples isolated from patients with OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 and becker DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM153700OMIM300376DOID11723OMIM310200MESHD020388DOID0050661OMIM608161OMIM616151OMIM616152MESHD057826). the results indicate that the dxs164 locus apparently recombines with OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 5% of the time, but is probably located between independent sites of mutation which yield OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388. the breakpoints of some deletions are delineated within the dxs164 locus, and it is evident that the deletions at the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 locus are frequent and extremely large.. 
7802009	additional case of female monozygotic twins discordant for the clinical manifestations of duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 due to opposite x-chromosome inactivation. a pair of female monozygotic (mz) twins, heterozygous carriers for a deletion in the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene and discordant for the clinical manifestations of duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136, were analyzed by molecular studies, in situ hybridization, and methylation pattern of x chromosomes to search for opposite x inactivation as an explanation of their clinical discordance. results in lymphocytes and skin fibroblast cell lines suggest a partial mirror inactivation with the normal x chromosome preferentially active in the unaffected twin, and the maternal deleted x chromosome preferentially active in the affected twin. a review shows that mz female twins discordant for x-linked DOID4MESHD004194MESHC are not uncommon. twinning and x inactivation may be interrelated and could explain the female twins discordant for x-linked traits.. 
1127526	OMIM616000MESHD034141 in a neonate. a small-for-gestational-age infant, found to have OMIM616000MESHD034141 in the neonatal period, is reported and the twelve cases recorded in the world literature are reviewed. patients lacking this serum protein are essentially asymptomatic, apart from minimal ankle MESHD004487 and ease of MESHD005221. apparent compensatory mechanisms which come into play when serum albumin is low include prolonged half-life of albumin and transferrin, an increase in serum globulins, beta lipoprotein, and glycoproteins, arterial MESHD007022 with reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure, and the ability to respond with rapid sodium and chloride diuresis in response to small volume changes. examination of plasma amino acids, an investigation not previously reported, revealed an extremely low plasma tryptophan level, a finding which may be important in view of the role of tryptophan in albumin synthesis.. 
7857677	homozygous presence of the crossover (fusion gene) mutation identified in a type ii DOID1926OMIM230800OMIM230900OMIM231000MESHD005776 fetus: is this analogous to the gaucher knock-out mouse model? DOID1926OMIM230800OMIM230900OMIM231000MESHD005776 (gd) is an inherited deficiency of beta-glucocerebrosidase (ec 3. 1. 2. 45, gene OMIMMIM Number gba). in type i gd, the cns is not involved (nonneuronopathic), whereas in type ii gd (acute neuronopathic) cns involvement is early and rapidly progressive, while in type iii gd (subacute neuronopathic) cns involvement occurs later and is slowly progressive. the t6433c (l444p) substitution is prevalent in type OMIM230900DOID0110958DOID1926OMIM230800OMIM231000MESHD005776. it may occur alone as a single base-pair mutation but often is found as part of a complex allele containing additional gba nucleotide substitutions, g6468c (a456p) and g6482c (v460v), without (recncii) or with (rectl) g5957c (d409h). this complex allele is presumed to have formed by recombination (crossover, fusion) of the structural gene with the pseudogene, which contains the mutated sequences. two complex alleles have never been demonstrated to coexist in any individual. we devised a selective pcr method for the specific amplification of the normal and/or fusion gene. using this procedure we demonstrated the fusion gene in homozygous form for the first time, in a macedonian/ashkenazi jewish gd type ii fetus. both parents were carriers of the recombination. this was confirmed by direct sequence analysis. a previous conceptus in this family was stillborn at 36 weeks, with features of severe type ii gd. neonates showing a severe clinical phenotype, analogous to the early neonatal lethal DOID4MESHD004194 occurring in mice homozygous for a null allele produced by targeted disruption of gba, have been described elsewhere, but the specific mutations in these cases have not yet been characterized.

10403837	decrease in gtp cyclohydrolase i gene expression caused by inactivation of one allele in hereditary progressive DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421 with marked diurnal fluctuation. hereditary progressive DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421 with marked diurnal fluctuation (hpd; dopa-responsive DOID543OMIM612067OMIM614860OMIM615034OMIM615073OMIM616411MESHD004421, OMIM128230MESHC538007) have been recently found to be caused by a genetic OMIM188560 in the gtp cyclohydrolase i (gch1) gene. in this study, we quantified the mrna level of gch1 in phytohemagglutinin (OMIM169400DOID9631MESHD010381) -stimulated mononuclear blood cells from one japanese family that do not have a mutation in the coding region or splice junctions of the gene. the results showed that the amounts of the gch1 mrna were decreased to about 40% of the normal level in both patients and carriers. in addition, we found that the gch1 mrna was transcribed from only one allele, indicating that the other allele was in an inactive state. these results suggest that some novel mutations should exist on one of the alleles in some unknown region of the gch1 gene, and may decrease the gch1 mrna causing the hpd/OMIM128230MESHC538007 symptoms.. 
10447259	novel mutations in the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 protein gene and their effects on transcriptional, translational, and clinical phenotypes. OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 (was) is an x-linked recessive immunodeficiency characterized by DOID1588MESHD013921, DOID2723MESHD004485, and recurrent MESHD007239, and caused by mutations in the was protein (wasp) gene. wasp contains several functional domains through which it interacts with proteins involved in intracellular signaling and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. in this report, 17 wasp gene mutations were identified, 12 of which are novel. dna of affected males and obligate carriers was pcr amplified and analyzed by ssca, heteroduplex analysis, and direct sequencing. the effects of the mutations at the mrna and protein level were ascertained by rt-pcr and western blot analyses. all missense mutations were located in exons 1-4. most of the nonsense, frameshift and splice site mutations were found in exons 6-11. mutations that alter splice sites led to the synthesis of several types of mrnas, a fraction of which represented the normally spliced product. the presence of normally spliced transcripts was correlated with a milder phenotype. when one such case was studied by western blotting, reduced amounts of normal-size wasp were present. in other cases as well, a correlation was found between the amount of normal or mutant wasp present and the phenotypes of the affected individuals. no protein was detected in two individuals with severe was. reduced levels of a normal-size wasp with a missense mutation were seen in two individuals with OMIM313900MESHC564052. it is concluded that mutation analysis at the dna level is not sufficient for predicting clinical course. studies at the transcript and protein level are needed for a better assessment.. 
511159	incidence and characteristics of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants in japan. a total of 3000 men living in yamaguchi were screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency using beutlers spot test and three types of starch gel electrophoresis. these electrophoresis used a phosphate buffer system at ph 7. 0, a tris-edta-borate buffer system at ph 8. 6, and a tris-hydrochloride buffer system at ph 8.. fifteen g6pd-deficient variants were found at the rate of 0. 5% and classified into four groups. as new variants, g6pd konan, kamiube, and kiwa were identified. these three variants had a mild to moderate DOID2862MESHD005955 and were not associated with any clinical signs. g6pd konan had fast electrophoretic mobility as compared with normal levels, g6pd kiwa had slightly elevated electrophoretic mobility, and g6pd kamiube had normal electrophoretic mobility. these three variants had normal levels of km g6p, km nadp, and ki nadph, normal utilizations of both 2-deoxy-g6p and deamino-napd, normal heat stability, and a normal ph curve. the other variant was g6pd ube, which we had previously found in yamaguchi (nakashima et al., 1977). one boy with g6pd ube was korean

1307245	mutations in the candidate gene for OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849. recently, we and others have isolated a candidate gene for x linked OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 (nd) which was found to be deleted or disrupted in several patients. as a prerequisite for the identification of point mutations in the nd gene we have established the exon-intron structure of this gene. in 17 unrelated patients and 15 controls, pcr products derived from the promoter region, exons 1 and 2 as well as the coding part of exon 3 were analysed with the single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) technique. in 12 patients altered pcr fragments were detected which were studied in detail by direct sequencing. eleven different mutations were found, and all but one are likely to give rise to significant structural changes in the predicted protein. these findings, and the absence of functionally relevant base changes in healthy controls, emphasize the causal role of this candidate gene in OMIM310600DOID0060844MESHC537849 and pave the way for reliable diagnosis and carrier detection.. 
7874117	a single amino acid substitution (g103d) in the type ii collagen triple OMIM617671 produces OMIM156550DOID0080045MESHC537207. OMIM156550DOID0080045MESHC537207 is a moderately severe chondrodysplasia phenotype that results from mutations in the gene for type ii collagen, col2a1. characteristics of the disorder include a short trunk and extremities, mid-OMIM600901DOID0111084 hypoplasia, OMIM119540DOID674MESHD002972MESHC566991, DOID11830OMIM608367MESHD009216, OMIM180050DOID5327MESHD012163, and MESHD034381. recently, deletions of all or part of exon 12 have been identified in individuals with OMIM156550DOID0080045MESHC537207, suggesting that mutations within this region of the protein may primarily result in the OMIM156550DOID0080045MESHC537207 phenotype. we used sscp to analyze an amplified genomic dna fragment containing exon 12 from seven individuals with OMIM156550DOID0080045MESHC537207. an abnormality was identified in one patient. dna sequence analysis demonstrated that the patient was heterozygous for a g to a transition that implied substitution of glycine103 of the triple helical domain by aspartate. the mutation was not observed in dna from either of the clinically unaffected parents of the proband. protein microsequencing demonstrated expression of the abnormal allele in cartilage. these data demonstrate that point mutations which result in single amino acid substitutions can produce OMIM156550DOID0080045MESHC537207 and further support the hypothesis that alteration of a domain, which includes the region encoded by exon 12, in the type ii collagen protein leads to this disorder.. 
10434119	linkage analysis of 5 novel DOID0060239OMIM119300MESHC536528 kindreds to 1q32-q41 markers further supports locus homogeneity of the DOID4MESHD004194 trait. DOID0060239OMIM119300MESHC536528 (vws, mim 119300) is a rare OMIM178110MESHC566739 clefting condition with cardinal features of mucous MESHD003560 (lower-OMIM247610 pits) and clefts to the OMIM247610 and/or palate. the vws gene has been assigned to a locus in 1q32-q41 by linkage analysis and physical mapping. we have investigated 5 novel vws families through probands attended for DOID9296MESHD002971 and/or palate repair at the department of maxillofacial surgery of hopital trousseau, paris, in order to tentatively refine the genetic map of the vws region in 1q32-q41 and possibly identify unlinked pedigrees. linkage analysis was carried out to 6 microsatellite markers (d1s249, d1s425, d1s491, d1s205, d1s414, d1s425), yielding a maximum cumulative lod score of z = 3. 27 at theta = 0. 00 for d1s245. the innermost four markers were found to be tightly linked to one another, with no evidence for recombination. our results support linkage of vws within a region of tightly linked markers and do not favour locus heterogeneity of the DOID4MESHD004194 trait.
3578281	OMIM126070MESHD017496 in the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. cutaneous and ocular pigmentation were evaluated in 29 individuals with the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218). criteria for OMIM126070MESHD017496 OMIM612069MESHC567429OMIM606217MESHC565249OMIM115197MESHC566169DOID0110552OMIM606346DOID0110494OMIM609006OMIM300123MESHC567485DOID0111806OMIM610125MESHC566441DOID0110927OMIM161800OMIM611590MESHC566910OMIM613750MESHC563526 the presence of type i or ii skin, the lightest skin type in the family by history, and iris translucency on globe transillumination. on the basis of these criteria, 48% of the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 individuals were hypopigmented. the presence of OMIM126070MESHD017496 correlated with a small interstitial deletion on the proximal long arm of chromosome 15; however, this deletion was also found in individuals who did not meet the full criteria for OMIM126070MESHD017496. hairbulb tyrosinase activity and glutathione content, as well as urine cysteinyldopa excretion, were low in OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 individuals with and without OMIM126070MESHD017496 and did not separate these two groups. we conclude that OMIM126070MESHD017496 is found in a significant proportion of individuals with OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 and that the OMIM126070MESHD017496 may be associated with a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15. the mechanism for the OMIM126070MESHD017496 is unknown.. 
495634	deficiency of the fifth component of complement in human subjects. clinical, genetic and immunologic studies in a large kindred. the discovery of a large kindred with a heritable deficiency of the fifth component of complement (c5) has permitted the accumulation of new clinical, genetic and immunologic data concerning the role of c5 in human subjects. the proband, who has had nine episodes of disseminated gonococcal MESHD007239, has a hemolytic c5 level of approximately 0. 5 per cent of normal. no c5 protein was detectable, but low levels of functional c5 activity could be found using a sensitive bactericidal assay. the probands twin as well as another sister also had extremely low levels of hemolytic c5 (approximately 0. 5 per cent normal), but both these subjects have been healthy. hemolytic complement and bacteriolytic activity could be restored by the addition of purified c5. no chemotactic activity for polymorphonuclear leukocytes could be generated in the c5-deficient serums upon activation of either the classic or alternative pathways, again demonstrating the importance of c5 in human subjects for the production of chemotactic factors. the chemotactic responsiveness of the patients polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes to preformed chemotactic factors was not depressed. twenty-two of 32 other family members from three generations had depressed whole hemolytic complement levels. in 19 of 30 family members, levels of hemolytic c5 ranged from 13 to 64 per cent of normal. no linkage for OMIM609536DOID8158MESHC537005 and the a or b loci of the major histocompatibility complex could be found. these data suggest an autosomal codominant mode of inheritance of OMIM609536DOID8158MESHC537005. deficiency of c5 is compatible with good health, but it can be associated with repeated disseminated gonococcal MESHD007239 
8533762	a new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variant, g6pd orissa (44 ala-->gly), is the major polymorphic variant in tribal populations in india. DOID2862MESHD005955 (g6pd) is usually found at high frequencies in areas of the world where DOID12365OMIM609148OMIM611162MESHD008288 has been endemic. the frequency and genetic basis of DOID2862MESHD005955 have been studied in africa, around the mediterranean, and in the far east, but little such information is available about the situation in india. to determine the extent of heterogeneity of g6pd, we have studied several different indian populations by screening for DOID2862MESHD005955, followed by molecular analysis of deficient alleles. the frequency of DOID2862MESHD005955 varies between 3% and 15% in different tribal and urban groups. remarkably, a previously unreported deficient variant, g6pd orissa (44 ala-- > gly), is responsible for most of the DOID2862MESHD005955 in tribal indian populations but is not found in urban populations, where most of the DOID2862MESHD005955 is due to the g6pd mediterranean (188 ser-- > phe) variant. the kmnadp of g6pd orissa is fivefold higher than that of the normal enzyme. this may be due to the fact that the alanine residue that is replaced by glycine is part of a putative coenzyme-binding site.. 
1655284	germline mutations in the wilms' DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor gene are associated with abnormal urogenital development in OMIM194080DOID3764MESHD030321. OMIM194080DOID3764MESHD030321 is a rare human condition in which severe urogenital aberrations result in DOID1074MESHD051437, DOID3765DOID1923DOID3763MESHD012734, and wilms DOID162MESHD009369 (OMIM194070DOID2154MESHD009396). to investigate its possible role, we have analyzed the coding exons of the wilms DOID162MESHD009369 suppressor gene (OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396) for germline mutations. in ten independent cases of OMIM194080DOID3764MESHD030321, point mutations in the zinc finger domains of one OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 gene copy were found. nine of these mutations are found within exon 9 (zinc finger iii); the remaining mutation is in exon 8 (zinc finger ii). these mutations directly affect dna sequence recognition. in two families analyzed, the mutations were shown to arise de novo. wilms DOID162MESHD009369 from three individuals and one juvenile granulosa cell DOID162MESHD009369 demonstrate reduction to homozygosity for the mutated OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 allele. our results provide evidence of a direct role for OMIM194070DOID5183DOID2154MESHD009396 in OMIM194080DOID3764MESHD030321 and thus urogenital system development.. 
10366443	molecular basis of feline OMIM253220DOID12803MESHD016538: an animal model of DOID12798MESHD009083 vii. a family of domestic cats was found that exhibited clinical and biochemical abnormalities consistent with DOID12798MESHD009083 vii, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by OMIM253220DOID12803MESHD016538. beta-glucuronidase activity was undetectable in affected cat fibroblasts and restored by retroviral gene transfer of rat beta-glucuronidase cdna. beta-glucuronidase mrna was normal in affected cat testis by northern blot analysis. normal feline beta-glucuronidase cdna was cloned and characterized, and amplified from affected cat fibroblasts by reverse transcription coupled polymerase chain reaction. there was a g-to-a transition in the affected cat cdna that predicted an e351k substitution, destroyed a bsssi site, and eliminated gusb enzymatic activity in expression studies. multiple species comparison and the crystal structure of human beta-glucuronidase indicated that e351 is a highly conserved residue most likely essential in maintenance of the enzymes conformation. bsssi digestion of polymerase chain reaction products amplified from genomic dna indicated that affected cats were homozygous and cats with half-normal beta-glucuronidase activity were heterozygous for the missense mutation. carriers identified in this manner produced affected kittens in prospective breedings, and a feline OMIM253220DOID12803MESHD016538 breeding colony has been established.. 
10581027	loss-of-function mutations in the cathepsin c gene result in DOID3388MESHD010510 and palmoplantar DOID161MESHD007642. OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214, or DOID161MESHD007642 palmoplantaris with periodontopathia (OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214, mim 245000), is an autosomal recessive disorder that is mainly ascertained by dentists because of the severe DOID824MESHD010518 that afflicts patients. both the deciduous and permanent dentitions are affected, resulting in premature MESHD016388. palmoplantar DOID161MESHD007642, varying from mild psoriasiform scaly skin to overt hyperkeratosis, typically develops within the first three years of life. DOID161MESHD007642 also affects other sites such as elbows and knees. most OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214 patients display both DOID824MESHD010518 and hyperkeratosis. some patients have only palmoplantar DOID161MESHD007642 or DOID824MESHD010518, and in rare individuals the DOID824MESHD010518 is mild and of late onset. the OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214 locus has been mapped to chromosome 11q14-q21 (refs 7, 8, 9). using homozygosity mapping in eight small consanguineous families, we have narrowed the candidate region to a 1. 2-cm interval between d11s4082 and d11s931. the gene (ctsc) encoding the lysosomal protease cathepsin c (or dipeptidyl aminopeptidase i) lies within this interval. we defined the genomic structure of ctsc and found mutations in all eight families. in two of these families we used a functional assay to demonstrate an almost total loss of cathepsin c activity in OMIM245000DOID3389MESHD010214 patients and reduced activity in obligate carriers. 
8563759	brca1 deficiency results in early embryonic lethality characterized by neuroepithelial abnormalities. the breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 susceptibility gene, brca1, has been cloned and shown to encode a zinc-finger protein of unknown function. mutations in brca1 account for at least 80% of families with both breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051, as well as some non-familial sporadic DOID2394OMIM167000OMIM607893MESHD010051. the loss of wild-type brca1 in tumours of individuals carrying one nonfunctional brca1 allele suggests that brca1 encodes a tumour suppressor that may inhibit the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. to examine the role of brca1 in normal tissue growth and differentiation, and to generate a potential model for the DOID162MESHD009369 susceptibility associated with loss of brca1 function, we have created a mouse line carrying a mutation in one brca1 allele. analysis of mice homozygous for the mutant allele indicate that brca1 is critical for normal development, as these mice died in utero between 10 and 13 days of gestation (e10-e13). abnormalities in brca1-deficient embryos were most evident in the neural tube, with 40% of the embryos presenting with varying degrees of DOID0080016MESHD016135 and OMIM206500DOID0060668MESHD000757. in addition, the neuroepithelium in brca1-deficient embryos appeared disorganized, with signs of both rapid proliferation and excessive cell MESHD003643.. 
8301658	x linked recessive DOID1588MESHD013921. a saudi arab boy presented in early childhood with DOID1588MESHD013921, morphologically large and normal sized platelets, increased mean platelet volume, and a hypermegakaryocytic bone marrow. there was no clinical and laboratory evidence of any significant immunological abnormalities. similar findings in two other brothers suggested strongly that they were all suffering from an x linked recessive thrombocytopenic disorder. results of dna analysis with the probe m27 beta are consistent with x linkage and indicate also that the locus of the relevant gene lies close to or is identical to the locus of the gene for the OMIM301000DOID9169OMIM614493MESHD014923 (was). because of various features which include the presence of large and normal sized platelets (rather than small platelets) and freedom from significant immune deficiencies, it is likely that the x linked recessive DOID1588MESHD013921 in this family is an isolated entity quite distinct from the classical was phenotype. however, a modified expression of the was gene producing a mild phenotypic variant cannot be excluded entirely.. 
7315872	genetics of OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294 (OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294): an autosomal recessive trait with high gene frequency in sephardim of moroccan origin. we described 6 patients (from 3 families) affected with OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294 (OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294). all are sephardic jews of moroccan extraction. in view of the small number of OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294 patients diagnosed in the world (a total of 50 including our 6 patients), we are probably dealing with an ethnic subgroup with a high OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294 gene frequency, which we have estimated to be 1/108. since there are differences in expression in this DOID4MESHD004194, we recommend cholestanol study in cases of undiagnosed DOID83MESHD002386 or tendinous DOID3345MESHD014973 in childhood or early adolescence. the diagnosis in OMIM213700DOID4810MESHD019294 is important not only for genetic counseling, but also in veiw of possible treatment.. 
8408659	a missense mutation in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene with possible dominant effects on plasma high density lipoproteins. plasma hdl are a negative risk factor for DOID1936DOID2348OMIM108725MESHD050197. cholesteryl ester transfer protein (cetp; 476 amino acids) transfers cholesteryl ester from hdl to other lipoproteins. subjects with homozygous OMIM143470DOID0111369MESHC564591 caused by a gene splicing OMIM188560 have markedly elevated hdl; however, heterozygotes have only mild increases in hdl. we describe two probands with a cetp missense mutation (442 d  g). although heterozygous, they have threefold increases in hdl concentration and markedly decreased plasma cetp mass and activity, suggesting that the mutation has dominant effects on cetp and hdl in vivo. cellular expression of mutant cdna results in secretion of only 30% of wild type cetp activity. moreover, coexpression of wild type and mutant cdnas leads to inhibition of wild type secretion and activity. the dominant effects of the cetp missense mutation during cellular expression probably explains why the probands have markedly increased hdl in the heterozygous state, and suggests that the active molecular species of cetp may be multimeric.. 
2571579	OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816: no evidence for locus heterogeneity. a total of 63 families with OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 (hd) were examined for linkage between hd and g8 (d4s10). the families OMIM612069MESHC567429OMIM606217MESHC565249OMIM115197MESHC566169DOID0110552OMIM606346DOID0110494OMIM609006OMIM300123MESHC567485DOID0111806OMIM610125MESHC566441DOID0110927OMIM161800OMIM611590MESHC566910OMIM613750MESHC563526 57 caucasian, four black american, and two japanese. the combined maximum lod score was 87. 69 at theta = 0. 04 (99% confidence interval 0. 018-0. 071). the maximum frequency of recombination was 0. 03 in males and 0. 05 in females. fifty-seven families gave positive lod scores; five small families gave mildly negative lod scores. the maximum likelihood estimate of alpha, the proportion of linked loci, was 1. 0 with a lower 99% confidence interval of 0. 88. these data suggest that there is only one hd locus, although a second rare locus cannot be ruled out. 
3258663	homozygous and heterozygous deletions of the von willebrand factor gene in patients and carriers of severe DOID12531MESHD014842. severe DOID12531MESHD014842 is characterized by undetectable or trace quantities of von willebrand factor in plasma and tissue stores. we have studied the genomic dna of 10 affected individuals from six families with this disorder using probes from the 5 and 3 ends of the vwf cdna and with a probe extending from the 5 end into the central region. southern blots of restriction endonuclease digests and gene dosage analysis measurements carried out with quantitative slot blots of undigested genomic dna separated these patients into three groups. the first group consisted of a family with complete homozygous deletions of the vwf gene in the four probands. gene dosage analysis was consistent with heterozygous deletions in both of the asymptomatic parents and four asymptomatic siblings of this kindred (p less than 0. 01). the second group was comprised of a family in which there was a complete heterozygous deletion of the vwf gene in the proband and one asymptomatic parent, suggesting that a different type of genetic abnormality was inherited from the other parent. thus, the patient appeared to be doubly heterozygous for interacting genetic abnormalities affecting vwf expression. in the third group, no gene deletions could be detected. alloantibodies developed only in the kindred with homozygous deletions. these techniques should prove useful in identifying carriers of severe DOID12531MESHD014842 and also in defining patients predictably at risk of developing alloantibodies to vwf. 
7795591	spectrum of germline mutations in the OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 gene: a study of 232 patients with hereditary and non DOID4648DOID768OMIM180200MESHD012175. germline mutations in the OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 gene confer hereditary predisposition to OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175. we have performed a mutation survey of the OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 gene in 232 patients with hereditary or non DOID4648DOID768OMIM180200MESHD012175. we systematically explored all 27 exons and flanking sequences as well as the promotor. all types of point mutations are represented and are found unequally distributed along the OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 gene sequence. in the population we studied, exons 3, 8, 18 and 19 are preferentially altered. the range of frequency of detection of germline mutations is about 20%, indicating that other mechanisms of inactivation of OMIM180200DOID4648DOID768MESHD012175 should be involved. the spectrum of mutations presented here should help to improve the clinical management of OMIM180200DOID768DOID4648MESHD012175 and to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to MESHD063646.. 
2773936	pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194: an x-linked DOID863MESHD009422 of myelin metabolism with a novel mutation in the gene encoding proteolipid protein. the nosology of the inborn errors of myelin metabolism has been stymied by the lack of molecular genetic analysis. historically, pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 has encompassed a host of DOID863MESHD009422 that present with a deficit of myelin, the membrane elaborated by glial cells that encircles and successively enwraps axons. we describe here a pelizaeus-merzbacher pedigree of the classical type, with x-linked inheritance, a typical clinical progression, and a pathologic loss of myelinating cells and myelin in the central nervous system. to discriminate variants of pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194, a set of oligonucleotide primers was constructed to polymerase-chain-reaction (pcr) amplify and sequence the gene encoding proteolipid protein (plp), a structural protein that comprises half of the protein of the myelin sheath. the plp gene in one of two affected males and the carrier mother of this family exhibited a single base difference in the more than 2 kb of the plp gene sequenced, a c----t transition that would create a serine substitution for proline at the carboxy end of the protein. our results delineate the clinical features of pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194, define the possible molecular pathology of this dysmyelinating disorder, and address the molecular classification of inborn errors of myelin metabolism. patients with the classical form (type i) and the more severely affected, connatal variant of pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 (type ii) would be predicted to display mutation at the plp locus. the other variants (types iii-vi), which have sometimes been categorized as pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194, may represent mutations in genes encoding other structural myelin proteins or proteins critical to myelination.. 
7874163	cag expansions in a novel gene for OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 at chromosome 14q32.1. we have identified a novel gene containing cag repeats and mapped it to chromosome 14q32. 1, the genetic locus for OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 (OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827). in normal individuals the gene contains between 13 and 36 cag repeats, whereas most of the clinically diagnosed patients and all of the affected members of a family with the clinical and pathological diagnosis of OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827 show expansion of the repeat-number (from 68-79). southern blot analyses and genomic cloning demonstrates the existence of related genes. these results raise the possibility that similar abnormalities in related genes may give rise to DOID4MESHD004194MESHC similar to OMIM109150DOID1440MESHD017827. 
3659917	conservation of the duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 gene in mice and humans. a portion of the duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) gene transcript from human fetal skeletal muscle and mouse adult heart was sequenced, representing approximately 25 percent of the total, 14-kb OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 transcript. the nucleic acid and predicted amino acid sequences from the two species are nearly 90 percent homologous. the amino acid sequence that is predicted from this portion of the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene indicates that the protein product might serve a structural role in muscle, but the abundance and tissue distribution of the messenger rna suggests that the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 protein is not nebulin.. 
2303408	deficiency of the murine fifth complement component (c5). a 2-base pair gene deletion in a 5'-exon. to ascertain the molecular mechanism that causes murine OMIM609536DOID8158MESHC537005, genomic and cdna libraries were constructed from mouse liver dna and mrna employing the congenic MESHD013180 b10. d2/nsnj and b10. d2/osnj that are sufficient and deficient for c5, respectively. genomic fragments were isolated which correspond to pvuii and hindiii restriction fragment length polymorphisms associated with OMIM609536DOID8158MESHC537005. sequence analyses demonstrated that each of these polymorphisms resulted from single base pair substitutions and that neither substitution would probably cause or contribute to the OMIM609536DOID8158MESHC537005. sequence analyses of c5 sufficient and deficient cdnas revealed a 2 base-pair deletion in the deficient cdnas. the " ta " deletion was located near the 5 end of the cdna. this deletion shifts the reading frame of the c5 mrna so that the termination codon uga is present 4 base pairs downstream from the deletion. genomic dna was amplified and sequenced corresponding to the area surrounding the 2-base pair deletion. six c5-deficient MESHD013180, a/hej, akr/j, OMIM105650DOID1339MESHD029503/2j, nzb/b1nj, swr/j, and b10. d2/osnj, and four c5-sufficient MESHD013180, balb/cj, c57bl/6j, OMIM105650DOID1339MESHD029503/1j, and b10. d2/nsnj, were analyzed. the sequencing data revealed that the 2 base pairs were deleted from the c5 gene of each deficient mouse tested but not from the c5 gene of any sufficient mouse. these data demonstrate that  1) there is an identical 2-base pair deletion in an exon of the c5 gene in several different c5-deficient mouse MESHD013180; 2) the mrna transcribed from the OMIM609536MESHC537005 gene retains this deletion; and 3) this mutation should result in c5 MESHD011488.
2241452	recurrent DOID9471MESHD008581 in a patient with congenital deficiency of the c9 component of complement. first case of OMIM613825MESHC565165 in europe. we describe the first cases, to our knowledge, of OMIM613825MESHC565165 in europe that were detected in a swiss family, of which two members--one with a complete deficiency and the other with approximately half-normal c9 levels--experienced bacterial DOID9471MESHD008581. the index patient, a 56-year-old white man with a history of purulent DOID9471MESHD008581 at the age of 23 years, presented with an acute meningococcal DOID9471MESHD008581. no impairment of cellular immunity or immunoglobulin deficiency could be found. complement assays showed a complete deficiency of the c9 component, while the other individual component levels were normal and the hemolytic activity (measured using the ch50 assay) was only slightly reduced. a family study revealed complete OMIM613825MESHC565165 in the patients healthy brother and half-normal c9 concentrations in his sister, his son (who also had experienced an episode of bacterial DOID9471MESHD008581), and his niece, consistent with an inherited OMIM613825MESHC565165. this first case of recurrent DOID9471MESHD008581 in a white patient with complete OMIM613825MESHC565165 suggests that this complement OMIM188560 may also be a risk factor for bacterial, especially neisserial, MESHD007239.. 
6387532	bone marrow transplant in OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326. an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (bmt) from a normal hla identical sibling donor was performed in a 13-year-old boy with rapidly progressive OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326). engraftment and complete hematologic recovery occurred within 4 weeks, but neurologic deterioration continued. the patient died of an adenovirus MESHD007239 141 days after bmt. OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 is characterized by abnormally high plasma levels of very long chain fatty acids (vlcfa) as a result of impaired capacity to degrade them. ten days after bmt, the white blood cell vlcfa levels and enzyme activity became normal; after 3 months, there was progressive reduction of plasma vlcfa to levels only slightly above normal.. 
7458742	increased incidence of MESHD002386 in male subjects deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency in rbcs was found significantly more frequently in 210 male cataractous patients than in 672 control subjects of sardinian origin. the frequency of the deficiency was increasingly higher in presenile MESHD002386. in the g6pd-deficient group, the incidence of cortical and total MESHD002386 was also increased. it is suggested that decrease of the g6pd activity in the lens, which accompanies its deficiency in the erythrocyte, might play a role in the cataracto-genesis of these patients. moreover, DOID2862MESHD005955 should be added to other conditions, such as the galactosemic states and OMIM615026DOID8454MESHD012257, where MESHD002386 represent a sensitive indicator of metabolic abnormalities of the rbc..

2895982	tightly linked flanking markers for the OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800, with application to carrier assessment. the OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 (OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800) is characterized by congenital DOID83MESHD002386, DOID1059MESHD008607, and defective renal tubular function. a map assignment of OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 to xq24-q26 has been made previously by linkage analysis with dxs42 at xq24-q26 (theta = 0, z = 5. 09) and with dxs10 at xq26 (theta = 0, z = 6. 45). two additional families were studied and three additional polymorphisms were identified at dxs42 by using a 35-kb sequence isolated with the probe detecting the original polymorphism at dxs42. with additional OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 families made informative for dxs42, theta remained 0 with z = 6. 63; and for dxs10 theta = 0. 03 and z = 7. 07. evidence for placing OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 at xq25 also comes from a female with OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 and an x; 3 translocation. we have used the xq25 breakpoint in this patient to determine the position of OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 relative to the two linked markers. each derivative chromosome was isolated away from its normal counterpart in somatic cell hybrids. dxs42 was mapped to the derivative chromosome x containing xpterq25, and dxs10 was mapped to the derivative chromosome 3 containing xq25-qter. the markers dxs10 and dxs42 therefore show tight linkage with OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 in six families and flank the xq25 breakpoint in a female patient with an x; 3 translocation. linkage analysis with flanking markers was used to assess OMIM309000DOID1056MESHD009800 carrier status in women at risk. results, when compared with carrier determination by ophthalmologic examination, indicated that the slit-lamp exam can be a sensitive and specific method of carrier determination in many cases 
10716718	abnormal development of purkinje cells and lymphocytes in atm mutant mice. motor MESHD001259, immune deficiencies, and an increased risk of DOID162MESHD009369 are the characteristic features of the hereditary DOID4MESHD004194 MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684 (a-t), which is caused by mutations in the atm gene. through gene targeting, we have generated a line of atm mutant mice, atm (y/y) mice. in contrast to other atm mutant mice, atm (y/y) mice show a lower incidence of thymic DOID0060058MESHD008223 and survive beyond a few months of age. atm (y/y) mice exhibit deficits in motor learning indicative of DOID2786MESHD002526. even though we found no gross cerebellar degeneration in older atm (y/y) animals, ectopic and abnormally differentiated purkinje cells were apparent in mutant mice of all ages. these findings establish that some neuropathological abnormalities seen in a-t patients also are present in atm mutant mice. in addition, we report a previously unrecognized effect of atm deficiency on development or maintenance of cd4 (+) 8 (+) thymocytes. we discuss these findings in the context of the hypothesis that abnormal development of purkinje cells and lymphocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of a-t.. 
1303173	both mutations in g6pd a- are necessary to produce the g6pd deficient phenotype. the high prevalence of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency in african populations is due almost entirely to the enzyme variant a-, which differs from the wild-type g6pd b by two amino acid replacements, 68 val-- > met and 126 asn-- > asp. the non-deficient polymorphic variant g6pd a contains only the mutation 126 asn-- > asp. the frequencies of the g6pd a and of the g6pd a- genes in parts of africa are both about 0. 2. the 68 val-- > met mutation has not been found in a b background. this could be because the 68 val-- > met mutation happened to arise in an a gene in the first instance, or because the 68 val-- > met mutation alone is not sufficient to cause DOID2862MESHD005955. we have approached this question by producing g6pd b, a, a-, and g6pd 68 val-- > met in a bacterial expression system and analysing their biochemical properties. with each single mutation we found a slight decrease in both the specific activity and the yield of enzyme when compared to g6pd b. when both mutations were introduced together, there was a roughly additive effect on specific activity, but a much more drastic effect on enzyme yield (4% of normal). this synergistic effect was also demonstrated on thermal stability, especially at low nadp concentrations. comparable results were produced when the replacement 119 gln-- > glu was studied instead of 126 asn-- > asp. we infer that the coexistence of the two mutations is responsible for enzyme deficiency in g6pd a- because they act synergistically in causing instability of the enzyme.

2591962	recombination events that locate OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 distal to apoc2 on 19q. we previously reported a recombination in an individual with OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) which placed the markers d19s19 and apoc2 on the same side of the dm locus. haplotyping of this family with more recently characterized probes which are either tightly linked to dm or distal to the linkage group at q13. 2 shows that the dm locus is distal to apoc2. this is confirmed by other recombinants where dm segregates with distal probes. additional marker to marker recombinations in unaffected individuals are reported and support the order and orientation of the dm linkage group as pter- (insr, ldlr, s9) - (s19, bcl3, apoc2) - (ckmm, dm) - (s22, + + + prkcg) -qter. the data presented here cannot determine whether dm is proximal or distal to ckmm. the consequences of this probe order for antenatal diagnosis and future research aiming to isolate the gene which is affected in dm are discussed. 
10425038	new mutations, polymorphisms, and rare variants in the atm gene detected by a novel sscp strategy. the gene for MESHD001259-DOID1272MESHD013684, atm, spans about 150 kb of genomic dna. atm mutations are found along the entire gene, with no evidence of a mutational hot spot. using dna as the starting material, we screened the atm gene in 92 a-t patients, using an optimized single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) technique that detected all previously known mutations in the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) segments being analyzed. to expedite screening, we sequentially loaded the sscp gels with three different sets of pcr products that were pretested to avoid overlapping patterns. many of the dna changes we detected were intragenic polymorphisms. of an expected 177 unknown mutations, we detected approximately 70%, mostly protein truncating mutations (that would have been detectable by protein truncation testing if rna starting material had been available). mutations have now been defined for every exon of the atm gene. herein, we present 35 new mutations and 34 new intragenic polymorphisms or rare variants within the atm gene. this is the most comprehensive compilation of atm polymorphisms assembled to date. defining polymorphic sites as well as mutations in the atm gene will be of great importance in designing automated methods for detecting mutations.. 
10417280	MESHD019457 in the prader-willi and angelman DOID225MESHD013577 involves recombination between large, transcribed repeats at proximal and distal breakpoints. OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218) and OMIM105830DOID1932MESHD017204 (as) are distinct neurobehavioral disorders that most often arise from a 4-mb deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13 during paternal or maternal gametogenesis, respectively. at a de novo frequency of approximately. 67-1/10, 000 births, these deletions represent a common structural chromosome change in the human genome. to elucidate the mechanism underlying these events, we characterized the regions that contain two proximal breakpoint clusters and a distal cluster. novel dna sequences potentially associated with the breakpoints were positionally cloned from yacs within or near these regions. analyses of rodent-human somatic-cell hybrids, yac contigs, and fish of normal or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicated sequences (the end repeats) at or near the breakpoints. the end-repeat units are derived from large genomic duplications of a novel gene (herc2), many copies of which are transcriptionally active in germline tissues. one of five OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218/as patients analyzed to date has an identifiable, rearranged herc2 transcript derived from the deletion event. we postulate that the end repeats flanking 15q11-q13 mediate homologous recombination resulting in deletion. furthermore, we propose that active transcription of these repeats in male and female germ cells may facilitate the homologous recombination process. 
8530105	a 4-megabase yac contig that spans the langer-DOID14743OMIM190350MESHC536820 region on human chromosome 8q24.1: use in refining the location of the trichorhinophalangeal DOID225MESHD013577 and DOID206MESHD005097 genes (OMIM190350DOID14743MESHC536820 and OMIM133700DOID206). we have constructed a physical map covering over 4 mb of human chromosome 8q24. 1 and used this map to refine the locations of the genes responsible for langer-DOID14743OMIM190350MESHC536820. the map is composed of overlapping yac clones that were identified and ordered in relation to sequence tagged sites mapped to the langer-giedion chromosomal region on somatic cell hybrids. the minimal region of overlap of langer-DOID14743OMIM190350MESHC536820 deletions, previously identified by analysis of 15 patients, was placed on the map by analysis of 2 patients whose deletions define the endpoints. the chromosome 8 breakpoint of a balanced t (8; 9) (q24. 11; q33. 3) translocation from a patient with trichorhinophalangeal DOID225MESHD013577 (OMIM190350DOID14743MESHC536820) was found to be located just within the proximal end of the minimal deletion region. a deletion of 8q24. 11-q24. 3 in a patient with DOID206MESHD005097 was found to overlap the distal end of the OMIM150230DOID4998MESHD015826 deletion region, indicating that the OMIM133700DOID206 gene is distal to the OMIM190350DOID14743MESHC536820 gene and supporting the hypothesis that langer-DOID14743OMIM190350MESHC536820 is due to loss of functional copies of both the OMIM190350DOID14743MESHC536820 and the OMIM133700DOID206 genes 
8401501	genetic mapping of the breast-OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 DOID225MESHD013577 to a small interval on chromosome 17q12-21: exclusion of candidate genes edh17b2 and rara. a susceptibility gene for hereditary breast-OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051, brca1, has been assigned by linkage analysis to chromosome 17q21. candidate genes in this region include edh17b2, which encodes estradiol 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ii (17 beta-OMIM143095DOID0050813 ii), and rara, the gene for retinoic acid receptor alpha. we have typed 22 breast and breast-OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 families with eight polymorphisms from the chromosome 17q12-21 region, including two in the edh17b2 gene. genetic recombination with the OMIM114480DOID1612DOID3459MESHD001943 trait excludes rara from further consideration as a candidate gene for brca1. both brca1 and edh17b2 map to a 6 cm interval (between thra1 and d17s579) and no recombination was observed between the two genes. however, direct sequencing of overlapping pcr products containing the entire edh17b2 gene in four unrelated affected women did not uncover any sequence variation, other than previously described polymorphisms. mutations in the edh17b2 gene, therefore do not appear to be responsible for the hereditary breast-OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 DOID225MESHD013577. single meiotic crossovers in affected women suggest that brca1 is flanked by the loci rara and d17s78..

3012567	isolation of molecular probes associated with the chromosome 15 instability in the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. flow cytometry and recombinant dna techniques have been used to obtain reagents for a molecular analysis of the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218). hindiii total-digest libraries were prepared in lambda phage charon 21a from flow-sorted inverted duplicated no. 15 human chromosomes and propagated on recombination-proficient (le392) and recbc-, sbcb- (db1257) bacteria. twelve distinct chromosome 15-specific probes have been isolated. eight localized to the region 15q11----13. four of these eight sublocalized to band 15q11. 2 and are shown to be deleted in dna of one of two patients examined with the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. heteroduplex analysis of two of these clones, which grew on db1257 but not on le392, revealed stem-loop structures in the inserts, indicative of inverted, repeated dna elements. such dna repeats might account for some of the cloning instability of dna segments from proximal 15q. analysis of the genetic and physical instability associated with the repeated sequences we have isolated from band 15q11. 2 may elucidate the molecular basis for the instability of this chromosomal region in patients with the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 or other DOID4MESHD004194MESHC associated with MESHD002869 in the proximal long arm of human chromosome 15 
7543316	OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223: evidence for a possible dominant-negative rna mutation. the trinucleotide expansion mutation causing OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 is in the 3 untranslated region of a protein kinase gene. the molecular mechanisms by which the expanded repeat causes the clinically variable and multisystemic DOID4MESHD004194, OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223, are not understood. it has been particularly difficult to rationalize the dominant inheritance with the fact that the expansion mutation lies outside of the protein-encoding gene elements, and should not be translated into protein. here we use muscle biopsies from classical adult-onset OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 patients to study the accumulation of transcripts from both the normal and expanded dm kinase genes in patient muscle, and compare the results to normal and myopathic controls. we found relatively small decreases of dm kinase rna in the total rna pool from muscle; however, these reductions were not DOID4MESHD004194 specific. analysis of poly (a) + rna showed dramatic decreases of both the mutant and normal dm kinase rnas, and these changes were DOID4MESHD004194-specific. our findings are consistent with a novel molecular pathogenetic mechanism for OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223  both the normal and expanded dm kinase genes are transcribed in patient muscle, but the abnormal expansion-containing rna has a dominant effect on rna metabolism by preventing the accumulation of poly (a) + rna. the ability of the expansion mutation to alter accumulation of poly (a) + rna in trans suggests that OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 may be the first example of a dominant-negative mutation manifested at the rna level.. 
8004674	isolation of the gene for OMIM300842MESHC564038 that encodes a novel membrane transport protein. OMIM300842MESHC564038 is an x-linked multisystem disorder characterized by abnormalities in the neuromuscular and hematopoietic systems. we have assembled a cosmid contig of 360 kb that encompasses the mcleod gene locus. a 50 kb deletion was detected by screening dna from patients with radiolabeled whole cosmids, and two transcription units were identified within this deletion. the mrna expression pattern of one of them, designated as xk, correlates closely to the OMIM300842MESHC564038. xk encodes a novel protein with structural characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane transport proteins. nucleotide sequence analysis of xk from two unrelated mcleod patients has identified point mutations at conserved splice donor and acceptor sites. these findings provide direct evidence that xk is responsible for OMIM300842MESHC564038.. 
10790204	molecular basis of DOID0080155 in three israeli patients: identification of a complex mutant allele with p65l and k247q mutations, the former being an exonic mutation causing exon 3 skipping. very long chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase (vlcad) deficiency is a life-threatening disorder of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. we identified four novel mutations in three unrelated patients. all patients had the severe childhood form of OMIM201475MESHC536353 with early onset and high mortality. immunoblot analysis revealed that vlcad protein was undetectable in patients 2 and 3, whereas normal-size vlcad protein and an aberrant form of vlcad (4kda smaller) were detected in patient 1. as expected, null mutations were found in patients 2 and 3  patient 2 is homozygous for a frameshift mutation, del 4 bp at 798-801, and patient 3 is homozygous for a nonsense mutation 65c > a (s22x). patient 1 was homozygous for a complex mutant allele containing two alterations, including a 194c > t transition (p65l) and 739a > c transversion (k247q); in the case of p65l, the amino acid change does not reduce enzyme activity. however, the nucleotide change resulted in exon 3 skipping, whereas the latter k247q mutation had a drastic effect on enzyme activity. we verified these events by in vivo splicing experiments and transient expression analysis of mutant cdnas. the p65l mutation locates 11 bases upstream of a splice donor site of intron 3. this is an example of an exonic mutation which affects exon-splicing.. 
10932179	amino-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin show selective accumulation in striatal neurons and synaptic toxicity. OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 (hd) is caused by expansion of a glutamine repeat in the amino-terminal region of huntingtin. despite its widespread expression, mutant huntingtin induces selective neuronal loss in striatal neurons. here we report that, in mutant mice expressing hd repeats, the production and aggregation of n-terminal huntingtin fragments preferentially occur in hd-affected neurons and their processes and axonal terminals. n-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin form aggregates and induce neuritic degeneration in cultured striatal neurons. n-terminal mutant huntingtin also binds to synaptic vesicles and inhibits their glutamate uptake in vitro. the specific processing and accumulation of toxic fragments of n-terminal huntingtin in hd-affected striatal neurons, especially in their neuronal processes and axonal terminals, may contribute to the selective neuropathology of hd..

10441571	missense mutation in the alternative splice region of the pax6 gene in eye anomalies. the pax6 gene is involved in ocular morphogenesis, and pax6 mutations have been detected in various types of ocular anomalies, including DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783, DOID0060673OMIM604229MESHC537884, DOID2566, congenital DOID83MESHD002386, and foveal hypoplasia. the gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that recognizes target genes through its paired-type dna-binding domain. the paired domain is composed of two distinct dna-binding subdomains, the n-terminal subdomain (nts) and the c-terminal subdomain (OMIM115430DOID12169MESHD002349), which bind respective consensus dna sequences. the human pax6 gene produces two alternative splice isoforms that have the distinct structure of the paired domain. the insertion, into the nts, of 14 additional amino acids encoded by exon 5a abolishes the dna-binding activity of the nts and unmasks the dna-binding ability of the OMIM115430DOID12169MESHD002349. thus, exon 5a appears to function as a molecular switch that specifies target genes. we ascertained a novel missense mutation in four pedigrees with DOID0060673OMIM604229MESHC537884, congenital DOID83MESHD002386, axenfeldt anomaly, and/or foveal hypoplasia, which, to our knowledge, is the first mutation identified in the splice-variant region. a t-- > a transition at the 20th nucleotide position of exon 5a results in a val-- > asp (gtc-- > gac) substitution at the 7th codon of the alternative splice region. functional analyses demonstrated that the v54d mutation slightly increased nts binding and decreased OMIM115430DOID12169MESHD002349 transactivation activity to almost half.. 
1673289	a detailed multipoint map of human chromosome 4 provides evidence for linkage heterogeneity and position-specific recombination rates. utilizing the ceph reference panel and genotypic data for 53 markers, we have constructed a 20-locus multipoint genetic map of human chromosome 4. new rflps are reported for four loci. the map integrates a high-resolution genetic map of 4p16 into a continuous map extending to 4q31 and an unlinked cluster of three loci at 4q35. the 20 linked markers form a continuous linkage group of 152 cm in males and 202 cm in females. likely genetic locations are provided for 25 polymorphic anonymous sequences and 28 gene-specific rflps. the map was constructed employing the linkage and crimap computational methodologies to build the multipoint map via a stepwise algorithm. a detailed 10-point map of the 4p16 region constructed from the ceph panel provides evidence for heterogeneity in the linkage maps constructed from families segregating for OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 (hd). it additionally provides evidence for position-specific recombination frequencies in the telomeric region of 4p.. 
8566965	the murine homolog of the human breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 susceptibility gene brca1 maps to mouse chromosome 11d. the recently cloned human breast and OMIM167000DOID2394OMIM607893MESHD010051 susceptibility gene, brca1, is located on human chromosome 17q21. we have isolated murine genomic clones containing brca1 as a first step in generating a mouse model for the loss of brca1 function. a mouse genomic library was screened using probes corresponding to exon 11 of the human brca1 gene. two overlapping mouse clones were identified that hybridized to human brca1 exons 9-12. sequence analysis of 1. 4 kb of the region of these clones corresponding to part of human exon 11 revealed 72% nucleic acid identity but only 50% amino acid identity with the human gene. the longest of the mouse brca1 genomic clones maps to chromosome 11d, as determined by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. the synteny to human chromosome 17 was confirmed by cohybridization with the mouse probe for the OMIM162200DOID0111253MESHD009456-gene. this comparative study confirms that the relative location of the brca1 gene has been conserved between mice and humans. 
8101038	high residual arylsulfatase a (arsa) activity in a patient with late-infantile OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966. we identified a patient suffering from late-infantile OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 (OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966) who has a residual arylsulfatase a (arsa) activity of about 10%. fibroblasts of the patient show significant sulfatide degradation activity exceeding that of adult OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 patients. analysis of the arsa gene in this patient revealed heterozygosity for two new mutant alleles  in one allele, deletion of c 447 in exon 2 leads to a frameshift and to a premature stop codon at amino acid position 105; in the second allele, a g-- > a transition in exon 5 causes a gly309-- > ser substitution. transient expression of the mutant ser309-arsa resulted in only 13% enzyme activity of that observed in cells expressing normal arsa. the mutant arsa is correctly targeted to the lysosomes but is unstable. these findings are in contrast to previous results showing that the late-infantile type of OMIM250100DOID10581MESHD007966 is always associated with the complete absence of arsa activity. the expression of the mutant arsa protein may be influenced by particular features of oligodendrocytes, such that the level of mutant enzyme is lower in these cells than in others.. 
10802660	de novo deletions of snrpn exon 1 in early human and mouse embryos result in a paternal to maternal imprint switch. OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 (OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218) is a neurogenetic DOID4MESHD004194 characterized by infantile MESHD009123, gonadal hypoplasia, obsessive behaviour and neonatal feeding difficulties followed by MESHD006963, leading to profound OMIM601665OMIM618406DOID9970MESHD009765. OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 is due to a lack of paternal genetic information at 15q11-q13 (ref. 2). five imprinted, paternally expressed genes map to the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 region, mkrn3 (ref. 3), ndn (ref. 4), ndnl1 (ref. 5), snrpn (refs 6-8) and ipw (ref. 9), as well as two poorly characterized framents designated par-1 and par-5 (ref. 10). imprinting of this region involves a bipartite imprinting centre (ic), which overlaps snrpn (refs 10, 11). deletion of the snrpn promoter/exon 1 region (the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 ic element) appears to impair the establishment of the paternal imprint in the male germ line and leads to OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218. here we report a OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 family in which the father is mosaic for an ic deletion on his paternal chromosome. the deletion chromosome has acquired a maternal methylation imprint in his somatic cells. we have made identical findings in chimaeric mice generated from two independent embryonic stem (es) cell lines harbouring a similar deletion. our studies demonstrate that the OMIM176270DOID11983MESHD011218 ic element is not only required for the establishment of the paternal imprint, but also for its postzygotic maintenance.. 
1897530	molecular characterization of two DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 mutations: correlation of mutations with highly conserved domains in galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase. DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 is an autosomal recessive disorder of human galactose metabolism caused by deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (galt). the molecular basis of this disorder is at present not well understood. we report here two missense mutations which result in low or undetectable enzymatic activity. first, we identified at nucleotide 591 a transition which substitutes glutamine 188 by arginine. the mutated glutamine is not only highly conserved in evolution (conserved also in escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae), but is also two amino acid residues downstream from the active site histidine-proline-histidine triad and results in about 10% of normal enzymatic activity. the arginine 188 mutation is the most common DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 mutation characterized to date. it accounts for one-fourth of the DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 alleles studied. second, we report the substitution of arginine 333 by tryptophan, caused by a transition at nucleotide 1025. the area surrounding this missense mutation is the most highly conserved domain in the homologous enzymes from e. coli, yeast, and humans, and this mutation results in undetectable enzymatic activity, suggesting that this is a severe mutation. this second mutation appears to be rare, since it was found only in the patient we sequenced. our data provide further evidence for the heterogeneity of DOID9870DOID0111458DOID0111459DOID14695OMIM230200OMIM230350OMIM230400MESHD005693 at the molecular level, heterogeneity which might be related to the variable clinical outcome observed in this disorder.. 
10078732	neurophysiologic follow-up of long-term dietary treatment in adult-onset OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326. objective  to monitor the effects of dietary treatment in adult-onset OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 (OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326) by means of somatosensory evoked potentials (seps) and motor evoked potentials (meps). background  seps and meps have proved useful in revealing signs of progressively severe, central dying-back axonopathy in early stages of adult-onset OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326. methods  eight patients with adult-onset OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 underwent clinical examination, brain and spine mri, and sep and mep studies before and after 3 years of lorenzos oil dietary therapy. results  before treatment, brain mri was normal in five patients. three of these patients had pure spinal sep abnormalities and in the remaining two patients seps showed signs of involvement of both the spinal and cerebral somatosensory tracts. after treatment, the three patients with pure spinal abnormalities showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening, whereas the two patients with a more advanced stage of DOID4MESHD004194 (exhibited by seps) showed substantially unchanged clinical and neurophysiologic features. the patients with abnormal brain mri at the onset of treatment showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening. conclusions  lorenzos oil therapy had no effect on patients with evidence of inflammatory brain lesions. moreover, in patients without clear signs of inflammatory damage, this treatment does not modify significantly the natural course of the DOID4MESHD004194. however, because effective treatments should begin before the onset of severe MESHD009461, seps and meps should be considered to evaluate the effectiveness of other experimental treatments in the patient with a negative brain mri.
10577908	the molecular basis of OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111: mutation analysis of the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase gene. OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 (OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by DOID1697MESHD007057, DOID1059MESHD008607, spasticity, and deficient activity of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (faldh). to define the molecular defects causing OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111, we performed mutation analysis of the faldh gene in probands from 63 kindreds with OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111. among these patients, 49 different mutations-including 10 deletions, 2 insertions, 22 amino acid substitutions, 3 nonsense mutations, 9 splice-site defects, and 3 complex mutations-were found. all of the patients with OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 were found to carry mutations. nineteen of the missense mutations resulted in a severe reduction of faldh enzyme catalytic activity when expressed in mammalian cells, but one mutation (798g-- > c [k266n]) seemed to have a greater effect on mrna stability. the splice-site mutations led to exon skipping or utilization of cryptic acceptor-splice sites. thirty-seven mutations were private, and 12 mutations were seen in two or more probands of european or middle eastern descent. four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) were found in the faldh gene. at least four of the common mutations (551c-- > t, 682c-- > t, 733g-- > a, and 798 + 1delg) were associated with multiple snp haplotypes, suggesting that these mutations originated independently on more than one occasion or were ancient OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 genes that had undergone intragenic recombination. our results demonstrate that OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 is caused by a strikingly heterogeneous group of mutations in the faldh gene and provide a framework for understanding the genetic basis of OMIM270200DOID14501MESHD016111 and the development of dna-based diagnostic tests.. 
7055648	severe-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency associated with chronic hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740, granulocyte dysfunction, and increased susceptibility to MESHD007239: description of a new molecular variant (g6pd barcelona). molecular, kinetic, and functional studies were carried out on erythrocytes and leukocytes in a spanish male with DOID2862MESHD005955, congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic DOID2355MESHD000740 (cnsha), and increased susceptibility to MESHD007239. g6pd activity was absent in patients red cells and was about 2% of normal in leukocytes. molecular studies using standard methods (who, 1967) showed g6pd in the patient to have a slightly fast electrophoretic mobility at ph 8. 0 with otherwise normal properties (heat stability at 46 degrees c, apparent affinity for substrates, optimum ph, and utilization of substrate analogues). other tests showed the patients granulocytes to engulf latex particles normally, but to have impaired reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium and ferricytochrome-c as well as reduced iodination. chemotaxis and random migration of the patients granulocytes were normal as were myeloperoxidase, leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (OMIM150270MESHC562861), and ultrastructural features. the molecular characteristics of g6pd in the patient differed from those of all previously reported variants associated with cnsha, so the present variant was provisionally called g6pd barcelona to distinguish it from other g6pd variants previously described. possible mechanisms for the severe deficiency of g6pd in erythrocytes and granulocytes was investigated by studies on the immunologic specific activity of the mutant enzyme. 
8162071	mutations at the pax6 locus are found in heterogeneous anterior segment malformations including peters' anomaly. mutation or deletion of the pax6 gene underlies many cases of DOID12271OMIM106210OMIM617141OMIM617142MESHD015783. three lines of evidence now converge to implicate pax6 more widely in anterior segment malformations including DOID0060673OMIM604229MESHC537884. first, a child with DOID0060673OMIM604229MESHC537884 is deleted for one copy of pax6. second, affected members of a family with dominantly inherited anterior segment malformations, including DOID0060673OMIM604229MESHC537884 are heterozygous for an r26g mutation in the pax6 paired box. third, a proportion of sey/+ smalleye mice, heterozygous for a nonsense mutation in murine pax-6, have an ocular phenotype resembling DOID0060673OMIM604229MESHC537884. we therefore propose that a variety of anterior segment anomalies may be associated with pax6 mutations.. 
10364525	in swedish families with hereditary OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471, linkage to the OMIM601518MESHC537243 locus on chromosome 1q24-25 is restricted to families with early-onset OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471. OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 clusters in some families, and an estimated 5% -10% of all cases are estimated to result from inheritance of OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471-susceptibility genes. we previously reported evidence of linkage to the 1q24-25 region (OMIM601518MESHC537243) in 91 north american and swedish families each with multiple cases of OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 (smith et al. 1996). in the present report we analyze 40 (12 original and 28 newly identified) swedish families with hereditary OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471 (OMIM167800MESHC537262) that, on the basis of 40 markers spanning a 25-cm interval within 1q24-25, have evidence of linkage. in the complete set of families, a maximum two-point lod score of 1. 10 was observed at d1s413 (at a recombination fraction [theta] of. 1), with a maximum npl (nonparametric linkage) z score of 1. 64 at d1s202 (p =. 05). the evidence of linkage to this region originated almost exclusively from the subset of 12 early-onset (age < 65 years) families, which yielded a maximum lod score of 2. 38 at d1s413 (straight theta = 0) and an npl z score of 1. 95 at d1s422 (p =. 03). estimates from heterogeneity tests suggest that, within sweden, as many as 50% of early-onset families had evidence of linkage to the OMIM601518MESHC537243 region. these results are consistent with the hypothesis of linkage to OMIM601518MESHC537243 in a subset of families with OMIM176807DOID10283OMIM607592MESHD011471, particularly those with an early age at diagnosis. 
2037285	localisation of the OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 locus to 19q13.2-19q13.3 and its relationship to twelve polymorphic loci on 19q. the order of fourteen polymorphic markers localised to the long arm of human chromosome 19 has been established by multipoint mapping in a set of 40 ceph (centre detude de polymorphisme humain, paris) reference families. we report here the linkage relationship of the OMIM160900OMIM602668MESHD009223 (dm) locus to twelve of these markers as studied in 45 families with dm. the resulting genetic map is supported by the localisation of the dna markers in a panel of somatic cell hybrids. ten of the twelve markers have been shown to be proximal to the dm gene and two, prkcg and d19s22, distal but at distances of approximately 25 cm and 15 cm, respectively. the closest proximal markers are apoc2 (apolipoprotein c-ii) and ckm (creatine kinase, muscle) approximately 3 cm and 2 cm from the dm gene respectively, in the order apoc2-ckm-dm. the distance between apoc2, ckm and dm (of the order of 2 million base pairs) and their known orientation should permit directional chromosome walking and jumping. the data presented here should enable us to determine whether or not new markers are distal to apoc2/ckm and thus potentially flank the dm gene.. 
10712225	a recurrent expansion of a maternal allele with 36 cag repeats causes OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 in two sisters. large intergenerational repeat expansions of the cag trinucleotide repeat in the hd gene have been well documented for the male germline. we describe a recurrent large expansion of a maternal allele with 36 cag repeats (to 66 and 57 repeats, respectively, in two daughters) associated with onset of OMIM143100DOID12858MESHD006816 (hd) in the second and third decade in a family without history of hd. our findings give evidence of a gonadal mosaicism in the unaffected mother. we hypothesize that large expansions also occur in the female germline and that a negative selection of oocytes with long repeats might explain the different instability behavior of the male and the female germlines.. 
10072428	germline e-cadherin gene (cdh1) mutations predispose to familial OMIM613659DOID10534OMIM137215MESHD013274 and OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179. inherited mutations in the e-cadherin gene (cdh1) were described recently in three maori kindreds with familial OMIM613659DOID10534OMIM137215MESHD013274. familial OMIM613659DOID10534OMIM137215MESHD013274 is genetically heterogeneous and it is not clear what proportion of OMIM613659DOID10534OMIM137215MESHD013274 susceptibility in non-maori populations is due to germline cdh1 mutations. therefore, we screened eight familial OMIM613659DOID10534OMIM137215MESHD013274 kindreds of british and irish origin for germline cdh1 mutations, by sscp analysis of all 16 exons and flanking sequences. each family contained  (i) two cases of OMIM613659DOID10534OMIM137215MESHD013274 in first degree relatives with one affected before age 50 years; or (ii) three or more cases of OMIM613659DOID10534OMIM137215MESHD013274. novel germline cdh1 mutations (a nonsense and a splice site) were detected in two families (25%). both mutations were predicted to truncate the e-cadherin protein in the signal peptide domain. in one family there was evidence of non-penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179; thus, in addition to six cases of OMIM613659DOID10534OMIM137215MESHD013274, a cdh1 mutation carrier developed OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179 at age 30 years. we have confirmed that germline mutations in the cdh1 gene cause familial OMIM613659DOID10534OMIM137215MESHD013274 in non-maori populations. however, only a minority of familial gastric DOID162MESHD009369 can be accounted for by cdh1 mutations. loss of e-cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other DOID162MESHD009369, and our findings provide evidence that germline cdh1 mutations predispose to early onset OMIM114500DOID9256OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179. thus, cdh1 should be investigated as a cause of inherited susceptibility to both gastric and DOID9256OMIM114500OMIM608812OMIM611469OMIM612229OMIM612230OMIM612231OMIM612232OMIM612589OMIM612590OMIM612591OMIM612592OMIM615083MESHD015179.
3346017	germinal mosaicism in duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136. we have identified a duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) pedigree where the DOID4MESHD004194 is associated with a molecular deletion within the OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 locus. we have examined the meiotic segregation products of the common female ancestor using marker restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflps) detected by probes that lie within this deletion. these studies show that this female has transmitted three distinct types of x chromosome to her offspring. this observation may be explained by postulating that the mutation arose as a postzygotic deletion within this common ancestor, who was consequently germinally mosaic.. 
3347839	expression of the murine duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 gene in muscle and brain. complementary dna clones were isolated that represent the 5 terminal 2. 5 kilobases of the murine duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) messenger rna (mrna). mouse OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 mrna was detectable in skeletal and cardiac muscle and at a level approximately 90 percent lower in brain. OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 mrna is also present, but at much lower than normal levels, in both the muscle and brain of three different MESHD013180 of dystrophic OMIM309200MESHC564108 mice. the identification of OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 mrna in brain raises the possibility of a relation between human duchenne DOID9884MESHD009136 (OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388) gene expression and the DOID1059MESHD008607 found in some OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 males. these results also provide evidence that the OMIM309200MESHC564108 mutations are allelic variants of mouse OMIM310200DOID11723OMIM300376MESHD020388 gene mutations. 
7790377	human peroxisomal targeting signal-1 receptor restores peroxisomal protein import in cells from patients with fatal DOID906MESHD018901. two peroxisomal targeting signals, pts1 and pts2, are involved in the import of proteins into the peroxisome matrix. human patients with fatal generalized peroxisomal deficiency disorders fall into at least nine genetic complementation groups. cells from many of these patients are deficient in the import of pts1-containing proteins, but the causes of the protein-import OMIM188560 in these patients are unknown. we have cloned and sequenced the human cdna homologue (pts1r) of the pichia pastoris pas8 gene, the pts1 receptor (mccollum, d., e. monosov, and s. subramani. 1993. j. cell biol. 121  761-774). the pts1r mrna is expressed in all human tissues examined. antibodies to the human pts1r recognize this protein in human, monkey, rat, and hamster cells. the protein is localized mainly in the cytosol but is also found to be associated with peroxisomes. part of the peroxisomal pts1r protein is tightly bound to the peroxisomal membrane. antibodies to pts1r inhibit peroxisomal protein-import of pts1-containing proteins in a permeabilized cho cell system. in vitro-translated pts1r protein specifically binds a serine-lysine-leucine-peptide. a pas8-pts1r fusion protein complements the p. pastoris pas8 mutant. the pts1r cdna also complements the pts1 protein-import OMIM188560 in skin fibroblasts from patients--belonging to complementation group two--diagnosed as having neonatal OMIM300100DOID10588MESHD000326 or DOID905OMIM214100MESHD015211. the pts1r gene has been localized to a chromosomal location where no other DOID906MESHD018901 genes are known to map. our findings represent the only case in which the molecular basis of the protein-import deficiency in human DOID906MESHD018901 is understood. 
8012387	x-linked MESHD009128 DOID607MESHD010264 and pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 are allelic disorders at the proteolipid protein locus. three forms of x-linked MESHD009128 DOID607MESHD010264 (spg) have been defined. one locus (spg 1) maps to xq28 while two clinically distinct forms map to xq22 (OMIM312920DOID0110773MESHC536857). a rare x-linked dysmyelinating disorder of the central nervous system, pelizaeus-merzbacher DOID4MESHD004194 (OMIM312080OMIM601186DOID3210OMIM169500MESHD020371), has also been mapped to xq21-q22, and is caused by mutations in the proteolipid protein gene (plp) which encodes two myelin proteins, plp and dm20. while narrowing the genetic interval containing OMIM312920DOID0110773MESHC536857 in a large pedigree, we found that plp was the closest marker to the DOID4MESHD004194 locus, implicating plp as a possible candidate gene. we have found that a point mutation (his139tyr) in exon 3b of an affected male produces a mutant plp but a normal dm20, and segregates with the DOID4MESHD004194 (zmax = 6. 63, theta = 0. 00). it appears, therefore, that OMIM312920DOID0110773MESHC536857 and OMIM312080OMIM601186DOID3210OMIM169500MESHD020371 are allelic disorders
